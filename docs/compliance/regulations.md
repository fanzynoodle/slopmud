# Compliance Regulations Inventory

Living list of laws/regulations/standards that may apply to slopmud, plus notes on what we need to do to stay compliant.

Not legal advice. When in doubt, talk to a lawyer.

## Product Assumptions (Update As Needed)

- Online multiplayer roleplaying game.
- User-generated content (UGC): player chat + profiles/room text (as applicable).
- US-operated service, with potential international users.

## Regulations To Track

### Kids / Minors

- COPPA (US, under 13): parental notice/consent requirements if we collect personal info from kids under 13, or an explicit policy to block under-13 users.

### Privacy (General)

- State privacy laws (US): e.g. California (CCPA/CPRA) and other state privacy regimes depending on thresholds and user base.
- GDPR / UK GDPR (EU/UK): applies if we intentionally serve/target EU/UK residents or end up with meaningful EU/UK user activity.

### Content / Safety / Illegal Material

- CSAM reporting + preservation (US): provider reporting obligations when we obtain actual knowledge of apparent CSAM.
- Harassment/threats: no single universal statute for "processing a report", but we need clear enforcement policy and evidence handling.

### IP / Takedowns

- DMCA (US): copyright takedown process and repeat infringer policy if we host user content and want safe-harbor protections.

### Accessibility

- Web accessibility expectations (WCAG-aligned): relevant for web properties; legal obligations vary by jurisdiction and context.
