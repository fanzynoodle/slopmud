# DOCBOT-2 Plan

## Next

- Keep `docs/environments.md` and `Justfile` deploy recipes consistent.
- Add/refresh quick-start pointers for the web stack (`apps/static_web`, `web_homepage/`).
- Define a tiny "release note template" for devlog posts (what changed, why, and what broke).

## Later

- Consolidate doc duplication (ports and environment variables tend to drift).
- Add a short "runbook index" page that links to the right `just ...` commands.
