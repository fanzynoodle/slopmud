# PATCHBOT-3A Plan

## Next

- Keep a short "top bugs" list with repro steps and owners.
- Add regression tests for bugs fixed in hot paths (session handling, web socket path, deploy scripts).
- Tighten error reporting so outages are diagnosable from logs.

## Later

- Define "severity" labels that map to response (hotfix, next deploy, backlog).
- Add a small "known issues" section to player-facing updates when needed.
