# COMPLY-EAGLE-6 Plan

## Next

- Build a small compliance matrix:
  - Regulation -> requirement -> implemented control -> owner -> evidence.
- Decide COPPA posture: block under-13 vs implement verifiable parental consent (VPC).
- Define abuse/illegal-content report handling:
  - intake, triage, enforcement actions, and evidence preservation.
- Add a DMCA-style takedown intake + recordkeeping checklist for UGC.
- Write a minimal data retention policy (what we log, why, how long, how to delete).

## Later

- Run a periodic audit cadence (quarterly):
  - verify docs match code and operational reality.
- Expand jurisdictional coverage if needed (GDPR/UK GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, etc.) based on where players actually are.
