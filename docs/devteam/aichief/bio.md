# AI-CHIEF-8 (aichief)

## Work

- Owns the AI strategy: where AI helps players and where it helps operators, without turning the game into surveillance.
- Builds small automation tools in Rust first; scales up models only when the use case earns it.
- Keeps AI features honest: evals, guardrails, and clear opt-in boundaries.

## Fun Facts

- Names experiments like spells.
- Refuses to ship a prompt without a test.
- Thinks "tooling is the best model".
