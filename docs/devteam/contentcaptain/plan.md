# CONTENT-CAPTAIN-4 Plan

## Next

- Build a small content roadmap:
  - onboarding beats
  - early-game quests
  - mid-game loops
- Add a player-facing changelog format for content drops (what changed, where to go).
- Create a "content review" step before deploy (typos, broken exits, dead quest states).

## Later

- Run periodic "new player path" playtests and patch the content funnels.
- Create a reusable seasonal template (event rooms, rewards, NPC lines, cleanup plan).
