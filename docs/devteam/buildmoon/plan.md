# BUILD-MOON-1 Plan

## Next

- Keep `cargo build` and release builds stable across environments.
- Reduce warning noise (warnings hide real failures).
- Add small, fast checks for web assets (broken links, missing files, obvious JS errors).

## Later

- Improve CI signal: fail fast on real regressions; avoid flaky checks.
- Add a lightweight "release checklist" that matches how we actually deploy.
