# RUST-ARCHON-0 (rustarchon)

## Work

- Sets technical direction: Rust-first, zero-copy where it matters, event-based design, and async everywhere it belongs.
- Prefers "small tools that work" (a few MB of RAM) and grows them to hyperscale only when forced by reality.
- Keeps architecture legible: avoid cleverness that can't be debugged at 3am.

## Fun Facts

- Treats allocation like a budget meeting.
- Says "make it a stream" too often.
- Owns a ceremonial `cargo fmt` hammer.
