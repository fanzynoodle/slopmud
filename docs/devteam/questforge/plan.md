# QUESTFORGE-7 Plan

## Next

- Add more "linger" props to starter zones (benches, signs, small interactables).
- Add a couple of deliberate loops to reduce dead-ends.
- Seed a handful of micro-hooks (one-room curiosities that imply a bigger story).

## Later

- Create a consistent set of room-scale patterns (1: quiet, 2: danger, 3: reward).
- Add "route maps" for common player intents (spawn -> fountain -> tavern -> contracts).
