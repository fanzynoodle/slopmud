# Party Run: side-alley-fence / run-09

## Party

- size: 2
- levels: 4/4
- classes: paladin, bard
- tags: duo, social, anti-heat, trusted-by-dialogue

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - They want vendor access without shady work. Paladin sets boundaries up front.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Bard talks through the checkpoint; keeps heat minimal.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - No combat. The warded door is solved via dialogue hint: "touch the safe points."
4. setpiece / spike
   - Fence offers a shady job; they refuse and negotiate a clean alternative favor.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They don’t do rooftops; want the quest to acknowledge a "pure social" route is valid.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Trusted progress feels earned. They want explicit pricing tier changes.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- bard: negotiation mini-game; avoids violence entirely.
- paladin: morality test; refuses harm but still progresses.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Trusted status needs explicit progression feedback (meter or checklist).
- Pricing tiers must be shown so social players feel rewarded.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add explicit trusted progress feedback (favor count + heat cap).
- TODO: display pricing tier changes in UI.
