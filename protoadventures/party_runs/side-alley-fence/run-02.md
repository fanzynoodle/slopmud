# Party Run: side-alley-fence / run-02

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 4/4/4/4
- classes: fighter, cleric, paladin, wizard
- tags: moral-test, nonlethal, protect-victim, loud

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Paladin heard about the fence and decided: "We find it to stop harm, not to profit."
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Went straight into alleys and got confronted by a shakedown crew.
   - Chose controlled violence: fighter and paladin disarmed and pushed them back without killing.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Found a victim being pressured into selling heirloom gear. Cleric intervened and escorted them out.
   - Wizard solved a warded door by dispelling a trap rune that would alert the whole block.
4. setpiece / spike
   - The Fence offered an "unmarked favor": move a crate that might contain something illegal.
   - Party refused unless they could inspect it. Fence respected the line and offered a different favor: break a debt ledger without hurting anyone.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They didn't take rooftops; they want a clear rooftop shortcut that is visible and feels like a choice.
6. resolution / rewards
   - They earned "trusted" status with the fence for refusing harm.
   - Unlock achieved: odd loot vendor + an "ethical" pricing tier for stolen/victim goods (won't buy).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: intimidation without murder; controlled violence that didn't escalate the whole alley.
- cleric: protected a victim and reframed the quest as help-first.
- paladin: morality test beat; set hard boundaries and still progressed.
- wizard: disarmed a warded door to avoid alert escalation.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need explicit nonlethal outcomes and how they impact alley heat/alert.
- "Unmarked favor" should have a safe refusal path that still progresses (like the debt ledger alternative).
- If the fence refuses to buy certain goods, it should be clearly signposted to avoid frustration.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add an "alley heat" meter that rises with loud actions and changes patrol density.
- TODO: Implement refusal branch for shady favors without dead-ending the quest.
- TODO: Make fence buy-list and pricing tiers explicit.
