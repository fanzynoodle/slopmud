# Party Run: side-alley-fence / run-06

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 4/4/4
- classes: ranger, rogue, monk
- tags: trio, stealth, rooftops, shortcut-hunters

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - They want the attic door shortcut and trusted status.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Rooftops all the way. Ranger reads reconnection markers; monk handles jumps; rogue handles locks.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - No combat. One rooftop gap is the spike: miss it and you drop into a patrol line (heat risk).
4. setpiece / spike
   - Favor: courier tail. They do it from above, never touching street level.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They find the attic door but it’s locked behind trusted. This feels like a good long-term goal.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Base access achieved; trusted not yet. They want clearer "how to earn trusted" guidance.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- monk: rooftop traversal; movement is the win condition.
- rogue: lock/service access; avoids checkpoints entirely.
- ranger: tracking and route literacy; reads markers so rooftops aren’t random.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Rooftop reconnection points must be loud, or players get lost above the alleys.
- Trusted status requirements should be explicit (2 clean favors, low heat threshold).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add rooftop route markers and reconnection signage.
- TODO: define trusted requirements explicitly (favor count + heat cap).
