# Party Run: side-alley-fence / run-04

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 4
- classes: wizard
- tags: solo, careful, anti-heat, ward-solver

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the quest purely to get rid of odd loot clutter. Wants a safe, quiet solution.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Follows the symbol trail strictly. Avoids the checkpoint by taking a service door route.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - No combat. The only obstacle is the warded backroom door.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Disarms the ward by reading subtle tells (scratched safe contact points).
   - Favor offered: deliver a sealed pouch, "do not open." Wizard succeeds by following instructions and avoiding attention.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Finds rooftop access but chooses not to use it (solo risk). Wants a "low-heat, low-risk" shortcut option.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Gets base vendor access but not trusted status. Accepts it; wants a clean way to build trust later.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: warded door solver; makes "no combat" a real path.
- rogue: not present; would shine in service door bypass and shortcut discovery.
- bard: not present; would shine negotiating trusted status via clean favors.
- paladin: not present; would shine in morality framing without violence.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need explicit "clean trust" path to earn trusted status without shady work.
- Low-heat route should be visible so it doesn’t feel like players must gamble.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a clean-favor chain that grants trusted status (tail courier, deliver, recover lost item).
- TODO: add a visible "low-heat route" hint near the checkpoint (service door sign).
