# Party Run: side-alley-fence / run-05

## Party

- size: 2
- levels: 3/3
- classes: barbarian, sorcerer
- tags: duo, loud, heat-maxer, still-succeeds

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - They want the fence for profit and don’t care about subtlety.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Ignore symbols; walk straight into the checkpoint and start trouble.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Controlled violence fails: barbarian goes too hard, heat spikes, and a patrol arrives.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Favor offered: move a crate fast, no questions. They accept, do it loud, and get the job done.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Miss every stealth route; heat makes rooftop routes harder (should be a consequence).
6. resolution / rewards
   - Gets base vendor access but with worse prices due to high heat. This feels correct.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: brute path and intimidation; shows the cost of loud play.
- sorcerer: controls collateral and bursts patrol wave to escape.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Heat consequences need to be explicit and persistent (pricing, patrol density).
- There must still be a way forward for loud players so this isn’t a stealth-only quest.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: implement an explicit alley heat meter and show it in outcomes (prices/patrols).
- TODO: ensure at least one loud favor path that is hard but fair.
