# Party Run: side-alley-fence / run-08

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 5
- classes: warlock
- tags: solo, shady, accepts-unmarked-favor, future-hook

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Wants odd-loot prices and is fine doing shady work.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Uses symbol trail, but also bribes through the checkpoint (heat trade).
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Minor patrol skirmish when heat spikes.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Accepts an "unmarked favor" crate move. Gets paid more, but the fence implies a future obligation.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Misses rooftop route because they stay street-level.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Gets base access and a "favor owed" token (future). This is fun if it’s explicit and opt-in.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- warlock: makes "unmarked favor" feel like a pact: explicit, optional, future cost.

## Friction / Missing Content

- If favor-owed tokens exist, they must be loud and not surprise-punish later.
- Heat tradeoffs (bribe vs fight) need explicit numbers/tier changes.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define "favor owed" token UX and a safe payoff path later (opt-in quest).
- TODO: define explicit heat changes for bribe/fight/stealth outcomes.
