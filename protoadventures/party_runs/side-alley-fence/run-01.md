# Party Run: side-alley-fence / run-01

## Party

- size: 2
- levels: 3/3
- classes: rogue, bard
- tags: low-level, social-first, stealth, avoid-combat

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Heard a rumor at Town Market Row: "If you have weird loot, there's a fence in the alleys. Don't ask in daylight."
   - Took the lead to find the black market because they wanted to sell odd drops.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Rogue took rooftop lines to scout. Bard stayed street-level to listen for code words.
   - Found a graffiti symbol (three slashes inside a circle) repeated on alley corners; followed it.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - A gang checkpoint asked for a "toll". Bard talked them down by offering a small favor instead.
   - Rogue picked a lock on a service door to bypass a crowded choke.
4. setpiece / spike
   - The favor: deliver a sealed pouch to a door with a warded knocker without opening it.
   - Wizard-style ward text wasn't needed; instead, it was solved by "don't touch the obvious trap" and use the knock pattern.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Rogue found a hidden crawlspace that bypassed the checkpoint entirely, but only after they already negotiated through it.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Met the Fence in a backroom. The Fence tested them with one question: "Do you profit off pain?"
   - Bard chose "profit off opportunity, not victims" and got better prices.
   - Unlock achieved: ability to buy/sell odd loot at a new vendor.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- rogue: stealth route and lockpick bypass; found crawlspace shortcut.
- bard: negotiation mini-game; avoided combat and secured better prices.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Needs consistent symbol language so players can follow the "fence trail" without random guessing.
- The favor should be cleanly solvable by multiple classes (social, stealth, brute) with different costs.
- Price improvement should be obvious and persistent (not invisible flavor).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Define the alley symbol set (graffiti + chalk marks) and what each means.
- TODO: Provide 2-3 favor variants (delivery, tail a courier, recover a stash) to reduce repetition.
- TODO: Make pricing tiers explicit (base vs trusted).
