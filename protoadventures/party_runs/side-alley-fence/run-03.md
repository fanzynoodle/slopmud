# Party Run: side-alley-fence / run-03

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 5
- classes: monk
- tags: solo, rooftops, speedy, no-dialogue

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Wanted a fence unlock purely for convenience: sell odd loot, buy weird consumables.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Took rooftop traversal as the primary route. Treated the alleys like a parkour puzzle.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Avoided combat entirely by staying above street-level and using a ladder chain.
   - One rooftop gap required a timed jump because a wind gust (from Skybridge theme bleed) threatened to push them.
4. setpiece / spike
   - The favor was a courier tail: follow a runner without being seen, then tap a chalk mark at the right corner to prove you tracked them.
   - Monk succeeded by staying high and reading shadows.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found an "attic door" shortcut that drops directly into the fence backroom if you have trusted status.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Bare-minimum dialogue: fence respects competence, grants base vendor access.
   - Next time, monk wants a way to earn better prices without doing a shady job.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- monk: rooftop traversal shortcut and stealth tail from above; movement is the win condition.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Rooftop route needs clear signage for where it reconnects; otherwise it feels like wandering.
- Solo path should exist for people who don't want social heavy content.
- Trusted status should be earnable by "clean favors" (tail, deliver) not only shady work.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add rooftop route markers (flags, chalk, dangling cords) and clear reconnection points.
- TODO: Add at least one clean favor chain that builds trust without moral compromise.
- TODO: Define trusted shortcut (attic door) rules and requirements.
