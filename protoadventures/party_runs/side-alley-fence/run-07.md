# Party Run: side-alley-fence / run-07

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 5
- classes: druid, ranger, cleric, bard, paladin
- tags: party, ethical, protect-victim, clean-trust

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Paladin frames it as "we find the fence to stop harm and track stolen goods."
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Bard negotiates through the checkpoint without violence. Ranger tracks the symbol trail.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - They interrupt a bad deal involving a victim NPC; cleric protects and escorts them out.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Fence offers a shady favor. Party refuses and is offered a clean alternative (tail a courier, break a ledger without harm).
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Druid reveals a hidden cut-through via roots/growth (future) that bypasses one patrol.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Earn trusted status through clean choices. Fence refuses to buy victim goods and says so explicitly.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: morality test and clean refusal path.
- cleric: protect-victim beat; reinforces "no harm" branch.
- bard: negotiation and de-escalation; keeps heat low.
- ranger: tracking and route literacy.
- druid: reveals a hidden path via environment interaction (future hook).

## Friction / Missing Content

- The victim protection beat needs a clear resolution so it doesn’t feel like a random side scene.
- Clean trust path must be as rewarding as shady path (just different).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a clear victim-protection resolution (rep, trusted progress, or discount).
- TODO: implement at least one druid-forward hidden path interaction.
