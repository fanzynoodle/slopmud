# Party Run: side-alley-fence / run-10

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 5/5/5
- classes: fighter, cleric, wizard
- tags: trio, completionist, tests-favor-variants

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - They want the fence and also want to see if favors vary or repeat.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Use service door route to keep heat low.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - One patrol skirmish when they misstep; cleric stabilizes.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Fence offers three favor options (delivery, tail, ledger). They pick ledger and succeed.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - See rooftop route but skip it; want it to be a clearly optional skill lane.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Base access achieved. They want favors to be modular with consistent costs and repeatability rules.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: controlled violence that doesn’t escalate if rules are clear.
- cleric: protects victim and keeps low-heat run stable.
- wizard: ward/trap solver; makes stealth route fair.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Favor variants need clear selection UX and clear differences in heat/reward.
- Repeatability rules should exist (can you farm trusted? daily cap?).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: implement a favor selection UI with explicit heat/reward differences.
- TODO: define repeatability rules for favors and trusted progression.
