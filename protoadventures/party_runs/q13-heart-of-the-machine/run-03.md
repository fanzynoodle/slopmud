# Party Run: q13-heart-of-the-machine / run-03

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 17 (top of band)
- classes: paladin, bard, druid, sorcerer, monk
- tags: over-leveled, coordinated, clean

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they treat The Core as a raid-lite and ask if there is a "perfect run" reward.
2. Gate ring: bard assigns roles; lock 1-3 go fast with clean coordination.
3. Innerworks: monk trivializes movement hazards; druid interfaces with a biosystem panel and gets a one-time cadence shift.
4. Auditor arena: sorcerer deletes transition adds; paladin holds vow line; bard calls stack/spread perfectly.
5. Resolution: they want optional hard mode: "auditor counts mistakes" as a scoring run.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: vow beat; "we do not abandon the run" becomes a party buff concept.
- bard: cadence/coordination is the win condition; role assignment shines.
- druid: biosystem interface provides a meaningful lever (one-time boon).
- sorcerer: burst phase transitions and add windows.
- monk: precision movement turns lethal geometry into a skill flex.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need an opt-in scoring system (audit marks) with a reward so over-leveled runs have stakes.
- Provide clear messaging for "perfect run" constraints (no marks, no deaths, no resets).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add optional "Audited Run" toggle with reward scaling by marks.
- TODO: add a post-boss report that summarizes marks and mistakes.
