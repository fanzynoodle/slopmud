# Party Run: q13-heart-of-the-machine / run-05

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 16
- classes: bard, cleric, paladin, rogue, druid
- tags: social-build, diplomacy, bargain-avoidant

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they enter with the mindset: "talk to the machine first."
2. Gate ring: bard negotiates a "maintenance warrant" with a gate attendant construct, granting one lock hint and one optional bypass token.
3. Innerworks: druid interfaces with biosystems; learns that the auditor is not evil, just enforcing a protocol.
4. Lock 2: they use the bypass token to skip an optional add wave but accept one audit mark (explicit cost).
5. Auditor arena: paladin vow beat; cleric sustain; bard calls phases. They win without taking forbidden shard bargains.
6. Resolution: they want more explicit "machine diplomacy" that trades tempo for marks, not just combat.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- bard: diplomacy and role coordination; earns a bypass at a cost.
- cleric: sustained healing through long raid-lite pressure.
- paladin: vow beat and party discipline in geometry.
- rogue: lock disable and precision interaction under pressure.
- druid: biosystem interface; lore + one-time cadence lever.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need clear "non-combat" levers: bypass tokens, hint panels, or mark tradeoffs.
- Costs must be explicit and recorded (marks/debt).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a gate attendant construct that can issue a warrant/hint for a cost.
- TODO: add explicit text feedback: "auditor marks applied" with reason.
