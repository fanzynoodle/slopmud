# Party Run: q13-heart-of-the-machine / run-10

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 16
- classes: warlock, barbarian, cleric, wizard, bard
- tags: chaotic, bargain-heavy, wipe-once

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: warlock wants forbidden shards; barbarian wants to fight the heart; bard wants the story.
2. Gate ring: they accept a shard bargain early for tempo; they ignore the debt warning.
3. Innerworks: debt consequences appear as extra hazard intensity; they wipe when they panic-run a beam sweep.
4. Reset: bard imposes rules: cap debt at 2, call safe squares, never panic-run.
5. Locks: they succeed once disciplined.
6. Auditor arena: warlock takes one more shard; costs are explicit; cleric stabilizes; wizard controls; barbarian breaks windows; bard coordinates.
7. Resolution: bargains are fun when capped, explicit, and paid down via time or rewards.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- warlock: forbidden shard bargain system poster child.
- barbarian: shield-break/burst windows; learns discipline after wipe.
- cleric: recoveries after wipe; sustain through long phases.
- wizard: control and hazard understanding; keeps the run solvable.
- bard: coordination and cadence calling is the win condition.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Debt paydown must exist and be usable; otherwise bargains are just "press button for death later."
- Wipe recovery needs a clear checkpoint before the auditor arena.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add explicit `core_debt` paydown options in reset chambers (time or forfeit reward).
- TODO: add a guaranteed pre-arena reset pocket and ensure it clears 1 mark.
