# Party Run: q13-heart-of-the-machine / run-02

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 15 (bottom of band)
- classes: fighter, barbarian, monk, paladin, rogue
- tags: all-melee, stubborn, learns-geometry, wipe-once

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they enter The Core and immediately bounce off the first geometry hazard because they chase adds into lethal squares.
2. Gate ring: lock 1 is fine (rogue solves), but lock 2 punishes clustering and melee gets shredded by overlapping fields.
3. They wipe in Innerworks when they try to brute-force a moving-beam hallway. Lesson: "movement is the mechanic."
4. Reset: monk starts calling safe squares; fighter becomes "do not chase" enforcement; paladin calls stack/spread rules.
5. They use funnels in Approach corridors to make melee viable.
6. Locks 2 and 3 become solvable once they treat them as "hold position until window" instead of "kill everything now."
7. Auditor arena: they win by disciplined positioning. Barbarian breaks a shield window with a timed burst.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: discipline anchor; prevents chase deaths; holds the boss in safe geometry.
- barbarian: timed shield-break window; raw damage matters when windows open.
- monk: precision movement; becomes party’s "geometry caller."
- paladin: vow/disciplined play; protects the run from panic.
- rogue: lock solutions and mid-fight disable objective.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need very clear hazard lines and safe squares; melee must be able to read where to stand.
- Must provide at least one "reset chamber" so wipes don’t require replaying all three locks.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add explicit "safe square" marker language used everywhere in The Core.
- TODO: ensure a checkpoint after lock 2 (or after each lock) for wipe recovery.
