# Party Run: q13-heart-of-the-machine / run-08

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 16
- classes: fighter, ranger, monk, wizard, bard
- tags: movement-forward, clean, no-heavy-sustain

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they play it like a choreography dungeon.
2. Innerworks: monk and bard shine; safe-square calling turns hazards into skill expression.
3. Lock 2 becomes a dance: stack on safe squares, spread on beam sweep, regroup for burst window.
4. Auditor arena: fighter holds center; wizard controls adds; ranger deletes priority targets; bard calls cadence.
5. They finish with very few marks and want the game to acknowledge "clean geometry play."

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- monk: precision movement in lethal geometry.
- bard: cadence/coordination calls; turns chaos into choreography.
- fighter: center hold; prevents kiting into hazards.
- wizard: control add swarms; keeps movement lanes open.
- ranger: priority target deletion at range.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need strong audiovisual telegraphs for hazard cadence; otherwise this becomes frustrating.
- Provide an end-of-run report that celebrates clean play (low marks).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a "mark summary" report on boss completion (counts + reasons).
- TODO: ensure hazard telegraphs are consistent across locks and boss.
