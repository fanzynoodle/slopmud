# Party Run: q13-heart-of-the-machine / run-07

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 15 (under band)
- classes: barbarian, rogue, wizard, warlock, sorcerer
- tags: under-leveled, risky, debt-stacking, wipe-once

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they are under-leveled and decide to compensate with forbidden shard bargains.
2. Gate ring: lock 1 is fine; then they take a shard for tempo and stack debt.
3. Innerworks: debt increases hazard intensity; they misread the warning and wipe when a moving-beam phase overlaps with add wave.
4. Reset: wizard caps debt at 2 and forces a rule: "no more bargains; pay down if possible."
5. Locks 2-3: they treat it as perfection play: slow, deliberate, control-heavy.
6. Auditor arena: they win, but the debt system needs explicit paydown options and a cap to avoid accidental self-delete.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: breaks a shield window when it opens; also the chaos lesson.
- rogue: lock solver and mid-fight objective.
- wizard: rule-maker; converts wipe into a plan; control carries the run.
- warlock: bargain system poster child; creates risk texture.
- sorcerer: bursts transitions; deletes dangerous add windows.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Forbidden shard bargain UX must be loud: debt tokens, next consequence, cap, paydown.
- Under-leveled parties need at least one guaranteed reset pocket so a wipe doesn’t mean replaying everything.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define `core_debt` tokens (cap=2) + paydown in reset chambers.
- TODO: add one guaranteed reset chamber on the mainline before auditor arena.
