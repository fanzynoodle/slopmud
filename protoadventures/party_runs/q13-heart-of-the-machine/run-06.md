# Party Run: q13-heart-of-the-machine / run-06

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: all 16
- classes: fighter, cleric, wizard
- tags: small-party, steady, resource-tight

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they accept knowing The Core is tuned for coordination and they are short-handed.
2. Approach: wizard control is mandatory; fighter must hold perfectly; cleric ration sustain.
3. Locks: each lock takes longer because one person solving means two holding. They need a reset pocket after each lock.
4. Innerworks: geometry hazards are lethal because there are fewer bodies to bait adds away. They play extremely slow.
5. Auditor arena: they wipe once when they try to do a mid-fight disable without enough peel.
6. Second attempt: they assign strict roles and succeed, but it demonstrates small parties need extra safe squares and a clear checkpoint.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: single point of failure; holds boss safely.
- cleric: ration sustain; keeps the run alive through long duration.
- wizard: carries control and hazard solving; makes the content possible.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Small parties need more reset points and fewer simultaneous mechanics.
- Mid-fight disable objectives must scale (or be optional) for party size 3.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: scale mid-fight lock disable complexity by party size.
- TODO: add a checkpoint chamber after each lock for small parties.
