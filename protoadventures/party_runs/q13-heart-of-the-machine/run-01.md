# Party Run: q13-heart-of-the-machine / run-01

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 16
- classes: fighter, cleric, wizard, rogue, ranger
- tags: balanced, first-time, methodical

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: The Core gate opens after Q12. A gate ring hub provides a staging area and a warning: "the auditor counts your mistakes."
2. Gate ring: they learn three locks must be disabled to open the auditor arena. Each lock is a short "mechanic lesson" encounter.
3. Approach: ramp-up corridors with add waves. Ranger calls priority targets; fighter anchors; wizard controls lanes.
4. Innerworks: traversal hazards (moving beams, rotating fields). Rogue scouts safe squares; cleric stabilizes through chip damage.
5. Lock 1: precision sequence (rogue moment). They succeed by assigning roles: hold, solve, interrupt.
6. Lock 2: add swarm with geometry (wizard moment). They learn the zone wants "stack then spread" discipline.
7. Lock 3: sustain test (cleric moment). They nearly wipe when they try to brute-force instead of using a reset pocket.
8. Auditor arena: boss is "windows + adds + geometry." Fighter holds center; rogue disables a mid-fight lock; ranger deletes high-threat adds.
9. They win by saving burst for exposure windows and never stepping into "counted zones."
10. Resolution: The Core issues a seam access token; next gate opens.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: holds center and prevents boss from kiting; anchors safe squares.
- rogue: lock disable sequence; mid-fight precision objective.
- cleric: carries sustained damage phases; stabilizes after lock 3 near-wipe.
- wizard: solves innerworks geometry with control; makes add waves manageable.
- ranger: target priority calls and deletes high-threat adds at range.
- paladin: no paladin; would shine on vow beat and wipe-recovery morale.
- bard: no bard; would shine coordinating phases and calling "spread/stack" cues.
- druid: no druid; would shine interfacing with biosystems for one-time lever.
- barbarian: no barbarian; would shine breaking a shield window with raw damage.
- warlock: no warlock; would shine in forbidden shard side bargain.
- sorcerer: no sorcerer; would shine bursting phase transitions.
- monk: no monk; would shine in precision movement through lethal geometry.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a clear, consistent "mistake counter" concept (auditor counting) that is readable and not punishing by surprise.
- Must include at least one safe pocket/reset before the auditor arena.
- Lock puzzles need loud role assignment affordances: "who solves, who holds."

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define `audit_marks` stacks (sources, thresholds, recovery).
- TODO: add a near-arena reset pocket that removes 1 mark.
