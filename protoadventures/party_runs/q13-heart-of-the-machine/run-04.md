# Party Run: q13-heart-of-the-machine / run-04

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 16
- classes: wizard, warlock, sorcerer, rogue, ranger
- tags: no-healer, all-ranged, control-heavy, clean

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they plan around avoiding chip damage because there is no sustain.
2. Approach: ranger/rogue keep pulls small; casters control corridors.
3. Innerworks: they treat geometry hazards as "do not take any marks" and move only on safe windows.
4. Lock 1: rogue solves; others provide overwatch.
5. Lock 2: add swarms are easy with control; the only danger is greed (standing in marked zones).
6. Lock 3: sustain check is replaced by "do it perfectly": avoid marked zones, kite correctly, reset if needed.
7. Auditor arena: they win by perfection play; warlock accepts a forbidden shard mid-fight for a burst boon, which adds an extra hazard later (explicit debt).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: control defines the run; turns swarms into a puzzle.
- warlock: forbidden shard bargain creates texture and risk.
- sorcerer: burst windows; deletes transition adds.
- rogue: precision lock sequence and mid-fight disable.
- ranger: priority calls and safe pulls; route competence.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a clear rule for resets: when can you safely stop, and does the auditor punish stalling?
- If we add forbidden shard bargains, costs must be explicit and capped (debt tokens).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define "stalling" rules in auditor arena (safe wait vs escalation).
- TODO: define `core_debt` tokens for forbidden shard bargains (cap, consequences, paydown).
