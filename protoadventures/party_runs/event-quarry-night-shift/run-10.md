# Party Run: event-quarry-night-shift / run-10

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 4/4/4/4/4
- classes: druid, cleric, fighter, wizard, monk
- tags: under-leveled, elite-attempt, wipe-once, learning-run

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took objectives: elite + rescue, overconfident because they had 5 bodies even though they were low level.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Went straight for the elite route to "get it done" before patrols stacked. They ignored lantern lanes and got disoriented.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - First contact with the elite ended in a wipe because they couldn't read the wind-up in darkness and ate a burst while split by geometry.
   - On the second attempt, they played slow: stayed in lit pockets, cleared patrols, and used monk to scout corners.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Rescue escort became the real spike: the party had to maintain formation and keep escorts out of hazard lanes while resources were already low from the earlier wipe.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Missed the collapsed tunnel shortcut entirely. Even if they saw it, opening it felt too risky after the wipe.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Completed the rescue but failed the elite objective before the timer. It was a valuable stress test: "low level + low visibility" needs a fair learning curve.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- monk: corner scouting and pursuit discipline after the wipe; kept the second attempt from panic-chasing.
- cleric: stabilized the escort phase when the party was running on fumes.
- wizard: used control to prevent patrol stacking during the second attempt.
- fighter: held the choke when geometry forced them into a bad lane.
- druid: maintained attrition sustain and helped recover from the wipe psychologically (callouts, pace).

## Friction / Missing Content

- Under-leveled parties need clearer "do this first" guidance (lantern lanes, safe pockets) so the first attempt isn't a blind coin flip.
- Elite telegraphs must be readable in darkness; deaths from unseen wind-ups feel unfair.
- Event timer and objective state needs to be loud; after a wipe, parties need to know if they can still meet 2 objectives.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add foreman guidance text for under-leveled parties (recommended objective pair + safe route hints).
- TODO: Make elite burst telegraphs readable via audio + silhouette highlight in low visibility.
- TODO: Add a post-wipe objective/timer status panel: "time left, objectives remaining".
