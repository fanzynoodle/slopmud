# Party Run: event-quarry-night-shift / run-05

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 8
- classes: wizard
- tags: solo, elite-hunt, greedy, control-heavy

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took objectives: elite + cache, assuming solo control would cover the lack of bodies.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Ignored lantern lanes and instead used high ground and "keep a wall on one side" pathing to avoid patrol cross-lanes.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Cache room: patrol pressure spiked when the cache interact took too long; the wizard had to freeze the room and back off twice rather than "fight it out".
4. setpiece / spike
   - Elite engage window was tight. The wizard won by saving burst for the flee tell instead of dumping cooldowns on first contact.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found a maintenance catwalk that reconnects to the main pit above patrol paths; it felt like the intended solo lane.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Completed both objectives quickly with minimal terminal damage; got a clean-stop bonus style payout.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: controlled the cache room long enough to interact without getting surrounded.
- wizard: used illumination/LOS tricks so low visibility felt like a puzzle, not a debuff.
- wizard: timed burst at the flee tell to finish the elite before it escaped.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Solo lane needs explicit hinting; the catwalk felt great but was discovered by luck.
- Elite flee tell must be unmistakable in low visibility (audio + silhouette), or solos feel robbed.
- Cache interact needs a clearer "you are safe to channel" affordance (or a faster solo interact).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a foreman hint for a solo-friendly catwalk route (map scribble / one line of dialogue).
- TODO: Make elite flee tell extremely loud (audio callout + highlight).
- TODO: Add a cache interact affordance: cover pocket, shorter channel, or a defendable switch.
