# Party Run: event-quarry-night-shift / run-09

## Party

- size: 2
- levels: 8/8
- classes: rogue, ranger
- tags: duo, stealth, double-cache, fast-extract

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took objectives: "secure two caches" and explicitly skipped the elite.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Used a shadow route between lantern lanes; ranger called patrol cadence while rogue hugged cover to reach cache pockets.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - One cache room had a patrol that couldn't be avoided; they solved it by pulling the patrol away from the cache interact and returning during the gap.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Second cache was on a timer window. Rogue had to commit to the interact while ranger body-screened in near-dark.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found a maintenance ladder chain that bypassed one patrol choke; it felt like the intended duo shortcut.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Completed both cache objectives quickly with minimal fighting and no escort risk. Payout was stable and repeatable.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- rogue: cache interact timing and stealth positioning under patrol cadence.
- ranger: patrol route reading and body-screening for the second cache window.
- rogue/ranger: coordinated "pull away, then return" pattern to avoid a forced loud fight.

## Friction / Missing Content

- "Two caches" objective needs explicit text and markers; otherwise players don't know it's valid.
- Shadow routes need consistent signage so stealth isn't random guessing.
- Cache interact should show risk state (patrol proximity) so committing feels like a choice.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit shift objective variants (e.g. "secure 2 caches") and mark cache nodes clearly.
- TODO: Add consistent shadow-route markers readable by skilled players.
- TODO: Add cache interact danger UI (patrol proximity / alertness) to make the commit meaningful.
