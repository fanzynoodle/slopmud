# Party Run: event-quarry-night-shift / run-01

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 6/6/6/6
- classes: fighter, cleric, wizard, ranger
- tags: first-time, low-visibility, safe-route

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took night shift objectives: cache + rescue.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Followed lantern lanes and avoided patrol zones; ranger called silhouettes and footstep cadence so they didn't get clipped by unseen packs.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Low visibility made ranged threats scary until they learned audio cues and stayed in lit pockets.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Rescue escort got clipped by a patrol; fighter held a choke while wizard controlled the lane and cleric stabilized the escort line.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found the collapsed tunnel shortcut but didn't open it; staying quiet mattered more than speed on a first run.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Completed cache and rescue; skipped the elite; got solid payout and a clear mental model of patrol lanes and safe pockets.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger: patrol route reading and safe-lane calls in low visibility.
- fighter: held the escort choke when a patrol clipped the group.
- wizard: controlled/illuminated lanes so darkness felt readable instead of unfair.
- cleric: triaged escort chip damage and prevented a spiral wipe.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need loud telegraphs even in darkness; silhouettes alone are not enough.
- Patrol zones need clear boundaries; players shouldn't learn them only by getting clipped.
- Lantern lanes must not wash out telegraphs; lighting needs consistent contrast rules.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add clear audio cues for patrol approach and elite flee.
- TODO: Mark patrol lanes with subtle but learnable signage (rocks, paint, rope, lantern rhythm).
- TODO: Ensure lantern lanes are visible from range and do not hide telegraphs.
