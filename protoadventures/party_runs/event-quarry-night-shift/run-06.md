# Party Run: event-quarry-night-shift / run-06

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 6/6/6/6/6
- classes: barbarian, fighter, monk, rogue, paladin
- tags: all-melee, loud, shortcut, formation-play

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Picked objectives: rescue + elite. Plan: open shortcut, chain the route, and accept the patrol heat.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Barbarian opened the collapsed tunnel immediately to connect rescue <-> elite paths.
   - Rogue scouted ahead and marked "no-fight" patrol gaps so the melee ball could sprint through.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Loud play stacked patrols. The party had to maintain a tight formation so melee didn't get split by low-visibility geometry.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Elite tried to flee into darkness. Monk stayed glued to it and called direction while paladin anchored the group and prevented backline picks.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - The shortcut was the secret: it made chaining objectives viable, but it also guaranteed patrol escalation.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Completed rescue + elite with heavy attrition. It was successful but felt like a coin flip when patrols arrived from unseen angles.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: smashed the collapsed tunnel and owned the "loud shortcut" decision.
- monk: tracked the fleeing elite and kept melee contact in darkness.
- rogue: scouted patrol gaps and prevented the formation from getting split.
- paladin: held the protect line during stacked patrol pressure.
- fighter: controlled the choke when geometry forced a bad fight.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Patrol escalation rules need to be visible and predictable (a meter or clear thresholds).
- Melee vs fleeing elite needs a fair pursuit lane (no disappearing into unmarked dark exits).
- Shortcut signage should be explicit about its cost: "this will add patrols".

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a clear "patrol heat" indicator with deterministic escalation steps.
- TODO: Add a pursuit lane marker during elite flee (tracks, lights, audio callouts) so melee can follow.
- TODO: Put a sign/foreman warning on the collapsed tunnel: loud shortcut, guaranteed escalation.
