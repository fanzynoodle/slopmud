# Party Run: event-quarry-night-shift / run-02

## Party

- size: 2
- levels: 5/5
- classes: rogue, monk
- tags: stealth, cache-focus, no-heal

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took objectives: cache + elite (risky), assuming mobility would cover the lack of sustain.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Stayed off lantern lanes; used shadow routes and roof/ledge movement to avoid patrol cross-lanes.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Cache was easy; elite was hard because one mistake meant no recovery. They had to reset fights instead of trading hits.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Elite tried to flee; monk chased and kept contact while rogue hit weak points during the short burst window.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found the collapsed tunnel shortcut but didn't open it; too loud for a stealth-first duo.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Completed cache + elite with a clean finish and got bonus payout for low patrol heat.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- rogue: stole the cache under patrol cadence and avoided escalating the whole pit.
- monk: mobility in low visibility and chase finish on the fleeing elite.
- rogue/monk: executed a fast shadow-route loop that kept the duo out of sustained fights.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Stealth routes need consistent signage so it's not random guessing.
- Elite flee window must be fair for small parties (no "it left because you blinked").
- Shadow routes need clear reconnection points so duos don't get lost and time out.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add "shadow route" markers that skilled players can read (chalk, broken lanterns, trail flags).
- TODO: Tune elite flee timer and weak point visibility for small parties.
- TODO: Add clear reconnection signage between shadow routes and lantern lanes.
