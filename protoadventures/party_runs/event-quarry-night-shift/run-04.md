# Party Run: event-quarry-night-shift / run-04

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 4/4/4
- classes: fighter, rogue, cleric
- tags: under-leveled, rescue-first, lantern-lane, slow-play

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Foreman offered cache/rescue/elite; they picked rescue + one cache because they were under-leveled and wanted a "safe" win.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Stayed on lantern lanes and treated dark side paths as "only after scout". Rogue walked the edge and called patrol silhouettes before they entered lane.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - First patrol clip happened because the lane boundary wasn't obvious in darkness; fighter dragged the fight back into a lit pocket so the cleric could stabilize.
   - They learned that low-visibility ranged shots need an audio tell, otherwise it feels like taking damage from nowhere.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Worker rescue: the escort line got pressured by a second patrol pathing near the pit. Rogue snuffed one lantern to hide the group, but then everyone lost telegraph readability.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found the collapsed tunnel shortcut but refused it (too loud) and missed a faster link between rescue and cache.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Completed rescue and secured one ore cache, but ran out of event time before attempting the elite. Payout felt fair, but they wanted clearer "two objectives done" confirmation.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: held the lit choke so the party could read attacks and keep the workers behind a clear line.
- rogue: patrol reading and lane discipline; traded stealth for losing telegraphs when they snuffed the lantern.
- cleric: triaged chip damage and kept the escort from collapsing when visibility errors stacked.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Patrol boundary and "safe lane" language is too subtle in darkness; first-time parties need a clear read.
- Lanterns help navigation but can also wash out telegraphs; needs consistent contrast rules.
- Objective tracker needs a loud "you completed 2/2 shift objectives" moment at the end.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a predictable patrol boundary marker (rocks, rope, paint, sound) that reads in low light.
- TODO: Define a lantern/telegraph contrast rule so lighting never hides the important silhouettes.
- TODO: Add explicit objective completion UI + foreman callout when shift requirements are met.
