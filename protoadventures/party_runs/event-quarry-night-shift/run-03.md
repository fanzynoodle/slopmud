# Party Run: event-quarry-night-shift / run-03

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 8/8/7/7/7
- classes: barbarian, warlock, bard, paladin, sorcerer
- tags: loud, cursed-ore, shortcut, chaotic

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took objectives: elite + cache and decided to be loud on purpose.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Opened the collapsed tunnel shortcut immediately (barbarian) to chain objectives fast.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Loud route triggered extra patrols; bard had to keep comms coherent so the party didn't split in low visibility.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Warlock accepted the cursed ore vein for power; hazards/patrol pressure intensified for the rest of the shift.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Shortcut was the point; they used it to avoid a long backtrack and keep the timer from eating them.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Completed elite + cache but took heavy damage; payout was big but messy and felt like a deliberate risk trade.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: smashed the collapsed tunnel for the loud shortcut.
- warlock: cursed ore bargain created a real tradeoff under a timer.
- sorcerer: burst the elite before it escaped into darkness.
- paladin: protected the party through chaotic patrol stacking and kept workers from getting caught in the fight lanes.
- bard: coordinated objectives and regroup points when visibility was low.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Cursed ore bargain must be explicit and capped; otherwise it reads as delayed punishment.
- Loud route consequences should be predictable (heat meter / thresholds), not random pile-ons.
- Shortcut signage should clearly state its cost: "opening this will add patrols."

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit bargain UI for cursed ore (benefit/cost/duration) and cap stacking.
- TODO: Make patrol escalation rules predictable and visible (heat indicator).
- TODO: Ensure shortcut loud option is clearly signposted, including the expected consequence.
