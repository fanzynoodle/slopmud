# Party Run: q10-anchor-the-wind / run-05

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: all 15 (over-leveled)
- classes: fighter, cleric, ranger, wizard
- tags: over-leveled, bored-test, efficient

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they do it for chain unlock; expect to faceroll.
2. Fights: mobs melt. Wind hazards still matter. Geometry beats level.
3. Anchors: fast. Only interesting part is gust timing during interact.
4. Marshal: HP isn’t the challenge; phase mechanics are. They win cleanly by respecting add windows.
5. Resolution: they want optional hard mode (extra anchor, elite gust event) for better rewards.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger: still shines picking threats on long sightlines.
- wizard: makes add windows trivial; solves traversal with utility.
- cleric/fighter: mostly safety net.
- others: absent; zone needs optional bite.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Not enough optional difficulty for over-leveled parties.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an optional "fourth anchor" hard mode behind a risk lever.
- TODO: add marshal shield phase tied to adds so DPS can’t skip mechanics.
