# Party Run: q10-anchor-the-wind / run-06

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: all 11 (under-leveled)
- classes: paladin, rogue, cleric
- tags: under-leveled, cautious, no-caster

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: paladin frames it as protecting travelers; rogue wants the secret scaffold; cleric wants to stop people dying to wind.
2. Spans: they move slowly and fight only in windbreak pockets. Without caster utility, traversal is the challenge.
3. Anchor 1: success after one near-fail when a gust interrupts the interact. They learn to wait out gust windows.
4. Secret: rogue finds the side scaffold route and it becomes the run’s safety valve.
5. Anchor 2: far adds are annoying. They lure threats into corners and rotate who holds the crank.
6. Anchor 3: hardest. They wipe once to "fight near edge". Second attempt succeeds with strict rule: never chase adds toward rails.
7. Marshal: two attempts. They win by prioritizing adds and using paladin defensive windows to survive phase gusts.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: defensive escort and moral anchor; makes movement discipline feel like heroism.
- rogue: scaffold discovery and add-caller assassin role.
- cleric: sustain and hazard recovery; without it the run fails.
- wizard/ranger/sorcerer: absent; far adds are harder without ranged tools.
- fighter/monk/bard/druid/barbarian/warlock: absent.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Wipe recovery is demoralizing without a safe pocket.
- Need explicit lure tools for far adds and consistent cover language.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an anchorhouse checkpoint after anchor 2 (safe pocket).
- TODO: add a reusable lure tool (noise maker / flare) that pulls far adds into cover.
- wizard: converts chaos into solvable phases.
- bard: coordination and cadence are the win condition.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Bargain UX must be loud: token count, next consequence, paydown options.
- Need a mid-run safe pocket so wipes don’t require full re-clear.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: codify wind pact rules: max debt, escalating costs, paydown.
- TODO: add an anchorhouse checkpoint after anchor 2.
