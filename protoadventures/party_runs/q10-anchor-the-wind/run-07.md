# Party Run: q10-anchor-the-wind / run-07

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 12
- classes: bard, paladin, druid, fighter, rogue
- tags: social-builds, rescue-first, roleplay-heavy

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they insist on "keeping the bridge safe" and rescuing stranded workers before doing any repair.
2. Anchorhouse: bard negotiates for an official "evac token" that opens one sealed service door (future rep hook).
3. Span rescue: they hear a whistle in the wind and choose to detour to rescue two travelers clinging behind a panel (time cost, feels heroic).
4. Anchors: they repair anchors in the order that reduces risk for civilians (A2 first, then A1, then A3).
5. Druid tries to "read the wind" to find safe windows; it becomes the run’s roleplay glue.
6. Marshal: they try to parley. It fails, but changes the add rhythm into a more readable cadence (would be a great feature).
7. Resolution: they want explicit support for rescue-first play (rep, shortcuts, services) and nonlethal options.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- bard: negotiations, coordination, and making it about people, not just objectives.
- paladin: moral framing and protection during rescues.
- druid: signature druid beat: "read the wind" and shape safe movement choices.
- fighter: protects during rescues and anchor interactions.
- rogue: service door/scaffold access; makes rescues possible.
- cleric/wizard/ranger/barbarian/warlock/sorcerer/monk: absent.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Rescue choice needs explicit rewards and time tradeoffs.
- Parley trigger needs consistent rules.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an optional rescue sub-objective tied to span hazards and rewards.
- TODO: define a marshal parley trigger: fails but changes fight rhythm.
