# Party Run: q10-anchor-the-wind / run-03

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 13/13/13/12/12
- classes: sorcerer, warlock, druid, bard, barbarian
- tags: over-leveled, bargain-curious, lore-hounds, speedy

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the anchor job, but immediately looked for optional "wind pact" speed routes.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Preferred the main span and brute-forced packs with burst.
   - Learned burst doesn't solve knockback: they still lost time to edge resets when they got greedy near corners.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Anchor 1 was trivial, but taught the interact rhythm.
   - Anchor 2 had a "crank under fire" segment that forced commitment; barbarian shined.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Warlock accepted a wind pact for faster traversal (optional). It made wind lanes sharper and spawned an extra elite on the next anchor.
   - That extra elite made the run interesting even for an over-leveled party.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They found side scaffolds but didn't need them. They want scaffolds to be a real speedrunner bypass, not just "safer."
6. resolution / rewards
   - Wind Marshal span: add waves on gust thresholds.
   - Sorcerer burst adds, druid created safe movement windows, bard called cadence, and they won cleanly.
   - They wanted the "wind pact" consequences to be explicit and capped.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- sorcerer: burst add thresholds so knockback pressure didn’t stack with wave pressure.
- warlock: took the pact and owned the consequences; made the dungeon feel reactive.
- druid: interacted with currents/storms flavor; created safe windows and avoided edge greed.
- bard: cadence calls turned traversal into a solvable rhythm.
- barbarian: crank-under-fire anchor objective; brute forced commitment.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Over-leveled parties still need traversal pressure; Skybridge is good at that if knockback is fair.
- "Wind pact" opt-in needs clear terms and clear cap (one pact per run, or stacking but bounded).
- Side scaffold bypass should meaningfully save time, not only reduce danger.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Implement a clear, explicit wind pact choice (speed vs sharper lanes/elite spawns) with caps.
- TODO: Make side scaffolds a real alternate route with obvious reconnection points.
- TODO: Ensure Wind Marshal fight has safe squares and consistent gust timing cues.
