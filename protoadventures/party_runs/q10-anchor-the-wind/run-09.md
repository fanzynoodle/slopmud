# Party Run: q10-anchor-the-wind / run-09

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 12
- classes: ranger, ranger, rogue, monk, sorcerer
- tags: ranged-heavy, fast-clear, timing-first

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they speedrun anchors to unlock the next route.
2. Spans: ranger duo deletes ranged threats before they cause chaos; monk calls gust windows; rogue scouts scaffold secret.
3. Anchor 1 and 2: clean. They never start interact unless room is stabilized.
4. Anchor 3: one near wipe due to gust timing; they recover because they have strong ranged threat control.
5. Marshal: sorcerer burst trivializes add windows; they win first try.
6. Resolution: they want a clean-clear reward hook (cosmetic/token/rep).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- rangers: signature skybridge run: long sightline control.
- rogue: scaffold discovery and route shaving.
- monk: cadence caller; turns wind into a rhythm game.
- sorcerer: burst makes add windows safe.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a consistent penalty for dragging fights into anchor rooms (alert level or interact penalty).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define a Skybridge alert escalation if you chain-pull into anchor setpieces.
- TODO: add a perfect-clear reward hook.
