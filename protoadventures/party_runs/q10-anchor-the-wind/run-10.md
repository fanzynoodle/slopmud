# Party Run: q10-anchor-the-wind / run-10

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 12
- classes: warlock, barbarian, cleric, wizard, bard
- tags: bargain-heavy, chaotic, wipe-once

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: warlock wants to test wind pacts; barbarian wants to pull big; bard wants a story.
2. Spans: wizard control keeps them safe until barbarian fights near edge and gets punished.
3. Anchor 1: warlock takes a wind pact bargain. Repair is faster, but gust knockback is stronger for the next setpiece. They ignore the cost and wipe once.
4. Regroup: bard sets rules, cleric stabilizes, wizard controls. They cap bargains to one more.
5. Anchor 2 and 3: clean with discipline. They wait for gust windows and never chase adds to rails.
6. Marshal: they win by saving burst/control for add windows and respecting gust phases.
7. Resolution: bargains are fun if costs are explicit, capped, and persistent (debt tokens).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- warlock: optional bargain system’s poster child; adds risk texture.
- barbarian: chaos agent and then add clearer; learns discipline.
- cleric: hazard recovery and sustain after wipe.
- wizard: converts chaos into solvable phases.
- bard: coordination and cadence are the win condition.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Bargain UX must be loud: token count, next consequence, paydown options.
- Need a mid-run safe pocket so wipes don’t require full re-clear.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: codify wind pact rules: max debt, escalating costs, paydown.
- TODO: add an anchorhouse checkpoint after anchor 2.
