# Party Run: q10-anchor-the-wind / run-01

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 12/12/12/12
- classes: fighter, cleric, wizard, ranger
- tags: first-time, balanced, careful, learn-knockback

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the anchor job at `HUB_SKYBRIDGE_ANCHORHOUSE`: "Calibrate three anchors so the spans stop shifting."
   - NPC warned: "Wind throws you off the bridge. Watch the flags."
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Chose the main span first (fast but exposed), planning to backtrack to side scaffolds if it got too spicy.
   - After first knockback near an edge, they started moving as a tight group behind the fighter.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Span packs apply a vertigo-like debuff; cleric learned it is about positioning, not raw healing.
   - Anchor 1 had an "interact while holding position" objective; fighter anchored, wizard controlled adds.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Anchor 2 forced a rescue beat: travelers trapped in a side scaffold alcove.
   - They chose rescue (slower) and got rewarded with a safe shortcut ladder back to the main route.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Ranger spotted side scaffolds that looked like a bypass but signage didn’t mark them as safe/unsafe.
6. resolution / rewards
   - After anchor 3, the Wind Marshal span became accessible.
   - Boss fight was mostly about dodging knockbacks and interrupting a charge-up gust. They wiped once when two got punted.
   - Second pull: they fought from a marked "safe square" area and saved cooldowns for add waves.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: held bridgehead and literally stood between the party and knockback lanes.
- cleric: stabilized vertigo mistakes and called positioning discipline over raw throughput.
- wizard: controlled add waves at anchors; interrupted or forced safe windows on gust charge-ups.
- ranger: long sightlines counter-sniped wind shooters and called safe lanes.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Knockback telegraphs must be loud and directional (windup + lane indicator); otherwise failures feel random.
- Need consistent "safe square" language on spans (paint, bolts, grates) so players know where to stand on boss.
- Rescue beat should be clearly optional but meaningful (shortcut unlock is good).
- Side scaffold routes need signage so players recognize them as intentional alternates, not decorative geometry.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Define vertigo/knockback debuff rules and visual grammar.
- TODO: Mark safe squares on the Wind Marshal span and at least one anchor room.
- TODO: Add explicit signage for side scaffold bypass routes.
- TODO: Make rescue choice produce a clear, permanent route payoff.
