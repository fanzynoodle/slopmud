# Party Run: q10-anchor-the-wind / run-04

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 12
- classes: wizard, cleric, warlock, sorcerer, bard
- tags: all-casters, lore-hounds, cautious

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they treat it like infrastructure restoration. Bard extracts lore about "wind marshal protocols."
2. Spans: wizard control trivializes many fights, but gust hazards still punish mistakes.
3. Anchor 1: easy. They learn the crank UX.
4. Anchor 2: warlock takes an optional wind pact bargain: anchor repairs faster, but adds a lingering "wind debt" token (knockback stronger later).
5. Anchor 3: the debt makes gust windows scarier. Cleric becomes MVP stabilizing after hazards.
6. Marshal: they win first try by controlling add windows and respecting gust phases.
7. Resolution: bargains are fun if costs are explicit and capped.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: makes long-sightline rooms solvable and safe.
- cleric: hazard recovery and stabilization; keeps the run from spiraling.
- bard: cadence caller; turns gust windows into a rhythm.
- warlock: optional bargain adds pacing variance and story texture.
- sorcerer: burst deletes add windows in marshal phases.
- fighter/rogue/ranger/paladin/druid/barbarian/monk: absent; see TODOs.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Bargain UX needs standardization: opt-in, explicit cost, persistent marker.
- Need loud warning lines for gust phase changes.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: codify wind pact bargains (debt tokens, cap, paydown).
- TODO: add 1-2 lore objects on spans (reward curiosity without slowing run).
