# Party Run: q5-sunken-index / run-04

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 6/7/7/7/8
- classes: fighter, barbarian, monk, paladin, bard
- tags: all-melee, no-caster, tempo-play

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the quest because it promised a map unlock and a permanent token.
   - Asked whether water exposure is "damage over time" or "status stacking".
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Treated the stacks hub like a dungeon room: cleared, regrouped, then ran a spoke and returned every time.
   - Picked shrine 2 first because "objective fights" are less punishing for melee.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Tight aisles were good for melee control, but they lacked ranged options to handle shrine 2 objectives quickly.
   - Shrine 1 pulse forced movement; monk mobility made it easy, heavy armor made it harder.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Shrine 3 pin-and-rescue was the highlight. Paladin became the rescue captain and the party felt coordinated.
   - Shrine 4 decoys: they got it right because tells were readable, but they wanted the decoy penalty to be "time + pressure" not "instant death".
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found the lore-only secret and liked that it did not warp balance.
   - Wanted one small mechanical shortcut: a one-way drop from one shrine back to stacks (saves time, costs safety).
6. resolution / rewards
   - Decoder + choice landed, but they wanted a "party vote" affordance or an explicit confirmation step.
   - They picked factory based on vibe; wanted the ranger camp to react to the choice next time.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: held the stacks choke while others solved objectives; prevented chain pulls.
- barbarian: solved a bad overpull by deleting a priority target and restoring tempo.
- monk: trivialized pulse movement and taught the party how to read safe lanes.
- paladin: led rescue play in shrine 3 and framed the door choice as responsibility.
- bard: provided sustain and made the no-caster comp workable in longer fights.
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- druid: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Melee comps need at least one approach option for ranged-ish objectives (pull levers, break cases, or shove sprites out).
- The choice room should support group decision making (vote or confirmation prompt).
- Decoy punishment should be survivable and readable. It should feel like a sharp lesson, not a wipe lottery.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add one melee-friendly interaction option in shrine 2 so objectives are not "ranged only".
- TODO: Add an explicit confirmation step for the factory/reservoir choice.
- TODO: Ensure shrine 4 decoy punishment is pressure, not a hard wipe.
