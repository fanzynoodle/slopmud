# Party Run: q5-sunken-index / run-02

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 5/6/6
- classes: barbarian, rogue, warlock
- tags: under-leveled, no-healer, greedy, bot-fill-optional

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the quest because it sounded like a key to future routes.
   - Immediately asked if they could buy antidotes or anti-debuff consumables at the ranger camp.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Rushed into the stacks, triggered multiple packs, and almost wiped.
   - Learned to treat the stacks room as a safe-ish hub and to return there after each plate.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Shrine 4 decoys punished greedy grabs. They triggered two decoys and got overwhelmed.
   - They then slowed down, searched for tells, and the decoy lesson clicked.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Without a healer, flood pulses plus debuffs compounded quickly.
   - Their solution was to "short rest" repeatedly at the antechamber threshold. They asked if that should clear water exposure stacks.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They did not find a shortcut, and they strongly wanted one after the second decoy mistake.
   - Suggested a risky one-way drop that skips one shrine but adds a harder fight.
6. resolution / rewards
   - They finished with an assist bot added for the last shrine and the decoder.
   - They chose an unlock based on vibes because the choice room did not communicate what it changes right now.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: brute-forced the stacks choke when they overpulled and saved the run.
- rogue: learned the decoy tells and led the careful approach on attempt two.
- warlock: accepted a risky tradeoff to end fights faster and reduce exposure time.
- fighter: none
- cleric: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Under-leveled + no-healer needs a clear recovery loop. The antechamber threshold should clearly communicate what it resets (water exposure, debuffs, or neither).
- Shrine 4 decoys need readable tells so the lesson feels fair, not random.
- Choice room needs clearer framing so the party is not choosing blind.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Define "dry stone threshold" as an explicit recovery rule (what clears, what persists).
- TODO: Add readable decoy tells for shrine 4 and ensure the punishment scales by party size.
- TODO: Make the choice room show one immediate unlock hint per door.
