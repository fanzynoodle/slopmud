# Party Run: q5-sunken-index / run-06

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 6/7/7/8
- classes: cleric, druid, rogue, sorcerer
- tags: diplomacy-first, nonlethal-intent, lore-hounds

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Tried to get permission to "borrow" plates without fighting. The ranger framed it as a dangerous recovery mission, not theft.
   - Asked if mold sprites can be calmed/cleansed rather than killed.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Spent time in antechamber and asked whether the dry stone threshold "counts as safe" (it should).
   - Found the lore secret and treated it as the emotional core of the run.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - They attempted nonlethal language on sprites and sentries. They wanted a minimal "disable/power down" framing that does not change the combat loop.
   - Shrine 2 objective was good because it was compatible with "quiet" instead of "kill".
4. setpiece / spike
   - Shrine 1 pulse created urgency, but they wanted it to feel like rising water, not random damage.
   - Shrine 3 pin forced teamwork and felt fair, but they requested a short reminder that the pin can be broken by allies.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found the lore-only secret. Wanted one more lore-only note in the decoder chamber that implies future shard travel.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Choice room made them pause. They wanted the doors to present a moral framing as well as a logistics framing.
   - They chose factory because it sounded like "help workers" rather than "control water".

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- cleric: managed debuffs and framed recovery as cleansing, not just healing.
- druid: pushed nonlethal intent and made water exposure feel like an environmental story.
- rogue: handled decoy reading and made the careful approach feel skillful.
- sorcerer: controlled tempo so the party could keep roleplay intent without getting overwhelmed.
- fighter: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Nonlethal intent needs minimal support: alternative verbs and NPC lines, not new systems.
- Water exposure should be described consistently as "rising pressure" with clear resets at dry stone.
- Decoder/choice should include one lore line that ties the index key to future travel tech.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add minimal nonlethal phrasing for sprites/sentries (quiet/cleanse/disable) without changing mechanics.
- TODO: Add one decoder chamber lore line that foreshadows future shard travel.
- TODO: Add an optional moral flavor line to each door in the choice room.
