# Party Run: q5-sunken-index / run-05

## Party

- size: 3 (2 humans + 1 assist bot)
- levels: 6/6/7
- classes: ranger, wizard, bot:medic
- tags: bot-fill, two-humans, speedrun, route-optimized

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Accepted fast and asked only how water exposure resets.
   - Opted into a medic bot because they wanted to sprint and accept mistakes.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Ranger routed the shrines by reading signage, then returned to stacks between each.
   - Skipped the lore secret intentionally; still appreciated that it exists.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Shrine 1 pulse: they treated it like a "grab and go" race and it worked.
   - Shrine 4 decoys: readable tells let them avoid punishment entirely.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Decoder overcharge knob was chosen. The bot absorbed the extra pressure without making the run trivial.
   - They wanted the overcharge to be a choice with a clear, immediate reward (not vague).
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - No secret found (skipped).
6. resolution / rewards
   - Choice room was fast. They wanted the door text to explicitly say "you will unlock the other later".
   - They picked reservoir because they wanted water/power themes to continue.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger: navigation and route leadership; made the run feel like a clean expedition.
- wizard: controlled aisle pulls and solved the pin setpiece quickly.
- bot:medic: patched small mistakes and prevented a speedrun from becoming a wipe.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Assist bots must not solve puzzles or make choices. They should handle sustain only unless commanded later.
- Decoder overcharge needs explicit reward text and a clear "what got harder" explanation.
- Door choice text needs to be short, decisive, and unambiguous.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Ensure assist bot behavior does not handle shrine objectives automatically.
- TODO: Define decoder overcharge reward and pressure in one sentence each.
- TODO: Make choice room door text explicitly promise catch-up.
