# Party Run: q5-sunken-index / run-09

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 6/7/7/8/8
- classes: paladin, rogue, bard, druid, wizard
- tags: roleplay-heavy, nonlethal-intent, lore-hounds

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Interrogated the ranger camp about why the library is flooded and who "owns" the plates.
   - Accepted when framed as "rescue the index so routes can reopen safely".
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Moved slowly, used dry threshold as a ritual boundary, and treated water exposure as environmental pressure.
   - Read the lore secret aloud and asked for one additional decoder note to tie into future travel tech.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - They used nonlethal language and wanted NPC lines to reflect that (quiet/cleanse/disable).
   - Shrine 4 decoys created a nice tension moment when the rogue argued about which plate looked real.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Shrine 1 pulse felt best when described as rising water pressure; they wanted the messaging to lean into that.
   - Shrine 3 pin got a "hero moment" for the paladin who broke the pin with teamwork.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They wanted a second lore-only pocket in the stacks, no mechanical value.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Choice room: they wanted the doors to present moral framing clearly and to log the decision as a story beat.
   - Picked factory because it implied helping workers, not controlling water.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: framed the mission as stewardship and made the final choice feel like an oath.
- rogue: solved decoy tells and led careful plate retrieval.
- bard: decoded symbolism and demanded better lore payoff from the decoder.
- druid: leaned into cleanse/nonlethal framing and made water exposure feel like story.
- wizard: managed stacks control so the party could roleplay without constant wipes.
- fighter: none
- cleric: none
- ranger: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Roleplay parties need just a bit more lore: one extra decoder note and one extra stacks pocket is enough.
- Nonlethal intent should be supported via text, not mechanics; otherwise it becomes a bait-and-switch.
- The choice should be logged/echoed back as a narrative beat, not just a gate flag.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add one extra decoder lore note that foreshadows future shard travel.
- TODO: Add a second lore-only pocket in the stacks cluster.
- TODO: Echo the chosen door back as a story beat and log it clearly.
