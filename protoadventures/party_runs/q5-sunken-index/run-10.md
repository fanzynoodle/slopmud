# Party Run: q5-sunken-index / run-10

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 6/6/7/8
- classes: barbarian, fighter, rogue, wizard
- tags: overpull, chaos, lesson-test

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Accepted and immediately tried to rush plates without reading shrine telegraphs.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Overpulled in stacks repeatedly. The tight aisles punished them, but chokes made recovery possible.
   - Dry threshold became their reset anchor; they learned to retreat without feeling punished because shrine state did not reset.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Shrine 1 pulse taught tempo after they tried to brute force it.
   - Shrine 4 decoys punished greed. They triggered a decoy, fought the extra pack, and learned to slow down.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Shrine 3 pin almost killed the wizard; the fighter peeled and it became the standout moment.
   - Decoder overcharge was ignored because they were in recovery mode; they wanted it presented as optional and clearly safe to skip.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Missed the lore secret because they were rushing. They did not care, which is fine.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Choice room: they wanted a confirmation step so the rogue could not troll the decision.
   - Picked reservoir because the immediate meaning hint sounded like "next content".

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: stabilized overpull mistakes by deleting priority targets fast.
- fighter: held stacks chokes and executed the shrine 3 rescue.
- rogue: learned decoy tells the hard way and then became the careful leader.
- wizard: controlled stacks pulls when the party finally listened.
- cleric: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Overpull groups need the retreat/reset story to be very clear (dry threshold resets exposure, shrine progress persists).
- Choice room needs confirmation (or party vote) to prevent griefing.
- Optional knobs like decoder overcharge should be clearly marked as optional, with modest rewards.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Make retreat and dry-threshold reset messaging explicit and consistent.
- TODO: Add a confirmation step for door choice to prevent misclick/grief.
- TODO: Label decoder overcharge as optional with modest reward.
