# Party Run: q5-sunken-index / run-07

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 6/6/6/7/7
- classes: wizard, sorcerer, warlock, ranger, cleric
- tags: all-ranged, objective-focus, interruptless

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Treated the run like a surgical objective mission. Asked what resets at the dry threshold.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Ran spokes fast, returned to stacks between each, and avoided unnecessary fights.
   - Loved that plate socket progress was visible; it became their pacing tracker.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Shrine 1 pulse: readable telegraph made it a clean movement check.
   - Shrine 2 objective: they completed it quickly and wanted the objective markers to be unmistakable.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Shrine 3 pin: cleric got pinned once, and the team learned to peel instantly.
   - Shrine 4 decoys: they identified tells and avoided punishment; they wanted a "you were careful" payoff line.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found the lore-only secret and appreciated it did not slow the run too much.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Overcharged the decoder because it sounded fun. They wanted the reward to be explicit and modest.
   - Choice: picked factory based on the immediate meaning hint. Catch-up promise reduced anxiety.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: controlled stacks pulls in tight aisles and kept the party from chain-pulling.
- sorcerer: burst a dangerous wave to prevent exposure stacks from spiraling.
- warlock: took high-risk tempo plays to end shrine fights quickly.
- ranger: route-led and made signage feel like gameplay.
- cleric: handled debuffs and rescued the pin victim without losing tempo.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Objective UI/UX needs to be readable in text-only: clear markers for shrine 2 and clear tell lines for shrine 4.
- Decoder overcharge must state cost and reward explicitly, or players will ignore it.
- Water exposure must have a simple, consistent rule and messaging so parties can plan tempo.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Ensure shrine objectives have unmistakable text feedback for progress.
- TODO: Ensure decoder overcharge has explicit, modest reward messaging.
- TODO: Keep water exposure messaging consistent across all rooms.
