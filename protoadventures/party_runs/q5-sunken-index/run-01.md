# Party Run: q5-sunken-index / run-01

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 6/6/6/7
- classes: fighter, cleric, rogue, wizard
- tags: brand-new, balanced, cautious

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the quest at the ranger camp because it promised a persistent unlock token.
   - Asked what "do not linger in water" means mechanically.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Entered the antechamber, then decided to clear the stacks hub room before committing to any shrine spoke.
   - Chose shrines in a loop (north, east, south, west) to reduce confusion.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Tight aisles punished overpulls, which the fighter liked because it created clear chokes.
   - Mold sprites applying a debuff taught the cleric to prioritize cleanse and the wizard to avoid standing in the wrong spots.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Plate 1 flood pulse felt good, but they wanted a more explicit telegraph before it triggers.
   - Plate 3 pin-and-rescue was the highlight. Rogue got pinned once and the party learned to peel.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They did not find a secret. They expected one hidden "dry route" between two shrines to reward careful observation.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Got all four plates, unlocked the decoder, then hesitated at the choice room.
   - They wanted the choice to have an obvious short-term meaning, not just a future gate flag.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: held a choke in the stacks and prevented chain-pulls when the party got nervous.
- cleric: managed debuffs and stabilized the team through flood pulses.
- rogue: solved shrine 2 by focusing objectives; got a clean rescue in shrine 3.
- wizard: controlled crowding in the aisles and timed movement through the flood pulse.
- ranger: none (not in party)
- paladin: none (not in party)
- bard: none (not in party)
- druid: none (not in party)
- barbarian: none (not in party)
- warlock: none (not in party)
- sorcerer: none (not in party)
- monk: none (not in party)

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a concrete explanation of "linger in water" (stacking debuff, slowed movement, louder aggro, or similar).
- Each plate shrine needs a distinct, readable telegraph so parties do not feel surprised by pulses/pins.
- The choice room should give a one-sentence short-term promise for each door (what unlock it enables next session).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Define a consistent "water exposure" mechanic with clear feedback and a safe reset (dry stone threshold).
- TODO: Add explicit telegraphs for each shrine's gimmick (pulse, objective, pin, decoys).
- TODO: Add a short-term consequence hint for factory vs reservoir choice.
