# Party Run: q5-sunken-index / run-08

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 6/7/7
- classes: fighter, cleric, monk
- tags: three-stack, slow-play, completionist

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the quest because it promised persistent progress and a choice with consequences.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Played it like a methodical dungeon crawl. Tested the dry threshold repeatedly to learn what it resets.
   - Took the lore secret and asked if there are more "above water" pockets to reward exploration.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Shrine 1 pulse punished lingering, which taught tempo.
   - Shrine 2 objective was slower for them without ranged; they relied on melee-friendly interactions.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Shrine 3 pin: monk mobility made rescue play satisfying.
   - Shrine 4 decoys: they triggered one decoy on purpose to see the penalty, then retreated to reset exposure at dry stone.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They wanted a one-way shortcut that returns to stacks after decoding, to reduce backtracking.
6. resolution / rewards
   - They argued about factory vs reservoir and wanted a vote/confirm step to prevent misclick decisions.
   - Picked reservoir because the moral flavor line resonated more than the logistics.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: anchored the stacks chokepoint and prevented chain pulls.
- cleric: made exposure/debuff management readable; taught the party to reset at dry stone.
- monk: solved movement puzzles and made rescue play in shrine 3 feel heroic.
- rogue: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Three-person parties need the shrine 2 objective to remain doable without ranged cheese.
- Choice selection needs a "confirm" or "party vote" affordance, especially for groups that roleplay.
- Backtracking after decoding should not feel like dead time; consider a one-way return.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Validate shrine 2 objective is fair for 3-person, all-melee parties.
- TODO: Add a confirmation step to the choice room selection.
- TODO: Add a one-way return convenience after decoding (optional).
