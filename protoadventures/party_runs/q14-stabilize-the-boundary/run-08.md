# Party Run: q14-stabilize-the-boundary / run-08

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 18
- classes: fighter, ranger, monk, wizard, bard
- tags: movement-forward, choreography, clean

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Rift order: they start with rift 3 because it’s a movement puzzle and they have monk/bard.
2. Rift 3: blind spots are the whole game. Monk leads, bard calls timing, wizard controls adds so movement remains possible.
3. Rift 2: silence pockets force role swaps; ranger does stabilization while casters reposition.
4. Rift 1: gravity skew is solved by safe-square calling and never panic-running.
5. Rift 4: glass choir becomes a rhythm game: rotate actions, wait in anchor pocket, commit only on lulls.
6. Nexus: they win cleanly because banner callouts are consistent and they treat swaps like choreography.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- monk: movement mastery in shifting geometry.
- bard: comms and cadence calling; keeps chaos coherent.
- fighter: holds anchor pocket during knockback phases.
- wizard: control keeps movement lanes open.
- ranger: threat deletion + stabilization role when casters are silenced.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Blind spot discovery must not be random. Needs consistent tells and a learnable pattern.
- Need a clear "phase swap stinger" for nexus so players can react instantly.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: standardize blind spot tells (marker language + rule banner hint).
- TODO: add a strong audiovisual swap stinger in nexus.
