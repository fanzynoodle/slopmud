# Party Run: q14-stabilize-the-boundary / run-03

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 20 (top of band)
- classes: paladin, bard, druid, sorcerer, monk
- tags: over-leveled, coordinated, wants-hard-mode

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they ask for an "audited run" equivalent. Edge station offers an opt-in: accept one temptation token for more rewards.
2. Rifts 1-4: they clear quickly; the only pressure is if they choose to engage optional anchor side objectives.
3. Choice: they pick `glass_choir` reinforcement because it rewards restraint and cadence (they like skill checks).
4. Nexus: druid uses a biosystem-like anchor to stabilize one swap; bard calls banners perfectly; monk movement trivializes geometry.
5. Resolution: they want explicit scoring: fewer reality debts, faster closures, more optional anchors stabilized.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: purpose anchor against temptations; makes refusal/acceptance a vow moment.
- bard: phase caller; comms discipline is the win condition.
- druid: restores local reality around living things; gets a one-time stabilizer lever.
- sorcerer: bursts transition windows cleanly.
- monk: precision movement through shifting geometry.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Over-leveled parties need opt-in difficulty knobs that are legible and rewarding.
- Temptations must be explicit and capped; "surprise debt later" feels bad.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an opt-in "Seam Pressure" toggle (hard mode) with clear reward scaling.
- TODO: add an end-of-run report: rifts closed, debt tokens, time, and optional anchors.
