# Party Run: q14-stabilize-the-boundary / run-01

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 18
- classes: fighter, cleric, wizard, rogue, ranger
- tags: balanced, first-time, methodical

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: edge station explains four rifts and the stabilizer nexus. The key line lands: "in the Seam, rules are part of the fight."
2. Rift 1 (gravity skew): they get tossed by knockback in a skewed gravity pocket and learn to fight inside anchor pockets instead of in open space.
3. Rift 2 (blue noise): silence pockets drift. Wizard learns to move; rogue/ranger do more work; cleric anchors recovery outside pockets.
4. Rift 3 (blind spots): collapsing geometry. Rogue finds "blind spots" by following consistent markers; wizard uses control to keep the path safe.
5. Rift 4 (glass choir): cast punishment pulse. They stop spam-casting and rotate roles; ranger/fighter do more while casters wait for windows.
6. Choice: they pick `blue_noise` reinforcement because it feels like "control stability" (more safe pockets, less caster punishment).
7. Nexus: boss swaps rule sets mid-fight. They win by calling the banner, moving to the right anchor, and treating each swap as a micro-setpiece.
8. Resolution: edge station stamps completion and opens seam gates (future).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: holds line when rules change; anchors parties in safe pockets during knockback.
- rogue: blind spot discovery and node access under chaos.
- cleric: chaos debuff recovery; keeps the run stable through long duration.
- wizard: solves rule-bending mechanics; control keeps geometry navigable.
- ranger: tracks safe paths and deletes high-threat anomalies at range.
- paladin: no paladin; would shine as "purpose anchor" against temptations.
- bard: no bard; would shine calling banners and keeping comms coherent.
- druid: no druid; would shine restoring local reality around living things.
- barbarian: no barbarian; would shine brute-forcing a collapsing-node window.
- warlock: no warlock; would shine in explicit temptation bargains.
- sorcerer: no sorcerer; would shine in burst windows during swaps.
- monk: no monk; would shine in movement mastery through skewed geometry.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Rule banners must be unmistakable and repeated on swaps; otherwise players feel bugged.
- Each rift needs a visible "anchor pocket" that is safe from the worst rule effect.
- Stabilization progress UI must be explicit (percent/steps + timer) so parties understand objective-first play.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define a standard rule-banner format + swap stinger for nexus phases.
- TODO: ensure each rift has an anchor pocket that is clearly safe and readable.
