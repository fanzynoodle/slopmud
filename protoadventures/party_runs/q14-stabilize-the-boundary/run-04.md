# Party Run: q14-stabilize-the-boundary / run-04

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 19
- classes: wizard, warlock, sorcerer, rogue, ranger
- tags: no-healer, all-ranged, control-heavy, clean

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Plan: avoid all chip damage. If the Seam applies chaos debuffs, they must have deterministic clears or safe pockets.
2. Rift 2 (blue noise) first: silence pockets drift. Rogue/ranger do anchor stabilization while casters reposition between lulls.
3. Rift 4 (glass choir): the anti-spam pulse forces them to rotate casting and accept that waiting is correct.
4. Rift 1: gravity skew is only scary if you panic-run. They win by standing on safe squares and moving on cadence.
5. Rift 3: blind spots puzzle is solved by rogue marking the path; wizard controls adds to keep the route safe.
6. Nexus: they win because they treat every swap as "new rules, new plan" and never greed-cast into choir pulses.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: control and hazard solving; keeps the run deterministic.
- warlock: temptation system’s poster child (they refuse bargains to keep it clean).
- sorcerer: burst only on safe windows; makes transitions short.
- rogue: blind spot marking and stabilization interactions.
- ranger: navigation and threat deletion in open anomaly terrain.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Must define whether waiting is safe: which rooms allow stalling without escalation.
- Glass choir needs clear counters (rotate roles, vary actions) rather than vague punishment.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define "safe wait" rules per rift (no escalation in anchor pockets).
- TODO: make glass choir counterplay explicit in the banner (rotate, vary, wait).
