# Party Run: q14-stabilize-the-boundary / run-06

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: all 19
- classes: fighter, wizard, cleric
- tags: small-party, steady, resource-tight

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Edge station: they understand immediately that multiple anchors will be hard with only three bodies.
2. Rift 2: "stabilize three anchors" becomes a problem. They need trio scaling (2 anchors) and partial progress persistence after wipes.
3. Rift 3: blind spots are solvable, but any mistake is lethal because they can’t spare peel.
4. They complete all four rifts, but it takes forever without a safe wait pocket and without partial progress.
5. Nexus: they wipe once to a phase swap because they can’t do the optional interlock objective. They need it to be optional for party size 3.
6. Second attempt: they ignore optional objectives and win by playing perfectly on banners.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: single point of failure; holds pocket so stabilization can happen.
- wizard: control and hazard solving; carries rift geometry.
- cleric: recovery and sustain through long endgame pressure.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Trio scaling is mandatory (anchor counts, collapse timers, optional objectives).
- Partial progress persistence prevents endgame frustration.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: explicitly scale rift anchor requirements for party size 3 (3->2).
- TODO: persist partial anchor progress (1/3 kept) after wipes.
