# Party Run: q14-stabilize-the-boundary / run-07

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 17 (under band)
- classes: barbarian, rogue, wizard, warlock, sorcerer
- tags: under-leveled, risky, temptation-curious, wipe-once

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they are under-leveled and decide to take temptations for tempo.
2. Rift 4: glass choir punishes their spam; they take a temptation to ignore one choir pulse, then forget the cost.
3. They wipe in rift 1 when the temptation cost shows up as worse knockback during gravity skew.
4. Reset: wizard caps temptation debt at 2 and forces the party to pay down when possible.
5. They finish all rifts, but only because they treat anchor pockets as checkpoints and play slow.
6. Nexus: temptations are fun, but only if costs are loud and there is a paydown option at the edge station.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: chaos agent then window breaker; learns discipline after wipe.
- rogue: node access and blind spot marking.
- wizard: rule caller; converts wipe into plan.
- warlock: temptation system poster child; creates risk texture.
- sorcerer: burst windows on swaps; keeps transitions short.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Temptation UX must be explicit: debt tokens, next consequence, cap, paydown.
- Under-leveled parties need a clearly guaranteed safe pocket per rift to prevent chain wipes.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define `reality_debt` tokens (cap=2) + explicit paydown (time or reward).
- TODO: ensure each rift has a guaranteed anchor pocket checkpoint.
