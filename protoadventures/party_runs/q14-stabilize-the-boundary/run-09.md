# Party Run: q14-stabilize-the-boundary / run-09

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 18
- classes: cleric, cleric, fighter, wizard, ranger
- tags: double-healer, safe, slow

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. They bring two clerics to brute-force chaos debuffs.
2. They learn quickly that healing cannot outheal geometry failures; you still die if you panic-run into collapse.
3. Rifts are slower but safe. Anchor pockets make them comfortable.
4. Nexus: they win by treating swaps as "new rules, new positions" and never assuming sustain saves them.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- cleric: debuff mitigation and sustain through long endgame pressure.
- fighter: holds pocket when knockback tries to scatter the party.
- wizard: control keeps safe squares available.
- ranger: deletes high-threat anomalies and does stabilization when casters are muted.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Keep failures lethal when they are positional; don’t allow healing to trivialize the lesson.
- Ensure chaos debuffs are clear and removable so healing parties don’t feel mandatory.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: ensure rift failures are primarily positional (not raw damage) so lessons stay coherent.
- TODO: add explicit debuff cleanse sources that are not "bring two clerics."
