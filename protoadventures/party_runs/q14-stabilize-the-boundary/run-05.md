# Party Run: q14-stabilize-the-boundary / run-05

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 18
- classes: bard, cleric, paladin, rogue, druid
- tags: social-build, diplomacy, temptation-aware

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Edge station: bard tries to get more clarity from the crew: what are "reinforcements" and what do they change?
2. They negotiate a "field protocol": the crew gives them one extra anchor charge, but they must accept one reality debt token (explicit trade).
3. Rifts: they take the safest route, using anchor pockets and disengage options. Rogue does the node work; cleric stabilizes chaos debuffs.
4. Choice: they pick `red_shift` reinforcement for brute stability (more physical anchors).
5. Nexus: paladin refuses temptations; bard keeps comms coherent on swaps; druid uses a living-thing anchor to stabilize one phase.
6. Resolution: they want more non-combat levers: protocol trades, explicit costs, and clear benefits.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- bard: negotiation and comms; keeps the run coherent.
- cleric: mitigates chaos debuffs; keeps party sane and stable.
- paladin: purpose anchor; refusal/acceptance of temptations is a vow beat.
- rogue: blind spot exploitation and node access.
- druid: biome anchor moment; restores local reality once.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need explicit description of what each reinforcement does (not just flavor).
- Non-combat trades must have explicit costs (debt/marks) and explicit benefits (extra anchor charge).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define reinforcement outcomes as concrete knobs per rule set.
- TODO: add an edge-station "field protocol" trade option (benefit for debt).
