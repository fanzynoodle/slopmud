# Party Run: q14-stabilize-the-boundary / run-02

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 17 (bottom of band)
- classes: fighter, barbarian, monk, paladin, rogue
- tags: all-melee, under-leveled, stubborn, wipe-once

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Edge station: they agree to a rule: "we never chase into unknown space."
2. Rift 1: gravity skew punishes them anyway. Barbarian tries to brute-force in open terrain and gets launched; they wipe when knockback chains.
3. Reset: monk becomes the "safe square caller"; fighter enforces discipline; paladin makes "hold the anchor pocket" the vow.
4. Rift 2: silence pockets don't hurt melee much, but they learn that casters being muted changes threat priority (more adds live longer).
5. Rift 3: blind spots are a movement puzzle. Monk and rogue shine; they win by moving as a single pack.
6. Rift 4: glass choir is mostly irrelevant to all-melee, but it teaches them to rotate responsibilities (one on stabilize, others peel).
7. Nexus: phase swaps are dangerous because melee wants to stay glued. They win by accepting disengage windows and re-anchoring on each banner.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: discipline anchor; holds the party together when knockback tries to scatter them.
- barbarian: brute-force attempt causes wipe, then becomes the timed window breaker.
- monk: movement mastery; safe-square calling turns chaos into choreography.
- paladin: purpose anchor; enforces the "hold the pocket" vow.
- rogue: blind spot discovery and node access under pressure.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Must make anchor pockets clearly melee-friendly (funnels, safe squares, readable cover).
- Knockback/gravity skew needs predictable directions so melee can learn it.
- Need a checkpoint rhythm so a wipe in rift 1 doesn’t feel like the entire run resets.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add consistent gravity-skew telegraphs (directional cue + warning text).
- TODO: guarantee a safe pocket near each stabilization node.
