# Party Run: q3-sewer-valves / run-07

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 5 (over band)
- classes: fighter, rogue, cleric, wizard, ranger
- tags: over-leveled, bored-test, speedrun

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. They steamroll valve rooms. Objective interactions are the only thing that slows them.
2. Grease King is still mildly interesting because slick patches punish stupidity, but the fight is fast.
3. They want optional knobs: "hard mode valves" or "elite grease add wave" for better reward.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- rogue: objective interaction timing is still the meaningful part.
- wizard: control keeps run clean even if over-leveled.
- fighter: anchor and speed.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Over-leveled run shows Q3 needs optional replay value knobs if it will be a repeatable.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an opt-in "overtime" mode that spawns extra adds for better reward.
