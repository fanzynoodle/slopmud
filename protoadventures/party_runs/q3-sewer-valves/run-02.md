# Party Run: q3-sewer-valves / run-02

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 3
- classes: fighter, barbarian, monk, paladin, rogue
- tags: all-melee, low-band, wipe-once, learns-hazards

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they treat it like a brawl and ignore the sludge warning.
2. Valve 2 first: sludge channel slows them and they try to turtle. Bad idea. They get chipped down and burn resources early.
3. Valve 3: grates room punishes melee if they stand in open. They learn to pull back to corners and force line-of-sight.
4. Valve 1: objective-under-pressure is fine; rogue turns valve while fighter/paladin hold.
5. Grease King: they wipe when barbarian chases adds into slick. Second attempt they win by using strict "safe squares" and letting adds come to them.
6. Reward: lever pull feels great; they immediately want to go see the shortcut.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: enforces discipline; holds chokes so melee can function.
- barbarian: chaos agent, then window breaker; learns "don’t chase into slick."
- monk: movement solves sludge and repositioning; becomes hazard caller.
- paladin: protects squishies and stabilizes morale after wipe.
- rogue: valve interaction under pressure; pulls ranged mobs into melee.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Melee needs readable cover pockets in grates corridors or the room feels like ranged tax.
- Boss slick patch telegraphs must be clear so it reads as geometry, not RNG.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add one explicit "pull back to corner to break LoS" hint in valve 3 corridor.
- TODO: add clearer slick patch boundary messaging.
