# Party Run: q3-sewer-valves / run-09

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 4
- classes: ranger, rogue, monk, wizard, sorcerer
- tags: movement-forward, grates-focus, clean

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Junction: they decide to do the grates/ranged branch first to get the hardest lesson out of the way.
2. Valve 3 corridor: monk and rogue use movement and corners; wizard/sorcerer delete ranged mobs.
3. Valve 2: sludge is annoying but not lethal if you keep moving.
4. Valve 1: simple objective room; they don’t overthink it.
5. Grease King: movement-forward party succeeds by constantly repositioning and never clumping.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- monk: movement solves LoS and sludge.
- rogue: valve interaction and scouting.
- ranger: picks off grates threats and calls targets.
- wizard: control keeps rooms clean.
- sorcerer: burst deletes add spikes in boss arena.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Valve 3 needs consistent "break LoS" cover language so this isn’t trial-and-error.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add consistent cover-pocket descriptions in grates corridors.
