# Party Run: q3-sewer-valves / run-06

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 2/3/3/3 (under-leveled stress test)
- classes: fighter, rogue, wizard, cleric
- tags: under-leveled, stress-test, wipe-once

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Entry: sludge hazards matter more; cleric spends too many resources early.
2. Valve 3: grates room almost wipes them. They learn to hard-reset pulls and play corners.
3. Valve 2: slow stacking nuisance becomes dangerous at low level; they need clearer hazard messaging.
4. Valve 1: objective under pressure is fine with good play.
5. Grease King: they wipe once. Second attempt they win by strict spread and by saving their few bursts for add spikes.
6. Reward: lever is the best feeling because it saves them from doing this again immediately.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: must hold perfectly to compensate for low level.
- rogue: scouting and valve interaction carry the run.
- wizard: control keeps them alive when numbers are against them.
- cleric: ration sustain; shows what happens when resources are thin.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Under-leveled runs need one extra safe pocket (junction) so wipes don’t cascade.
- Sludge/slow stacks must be loud and counterable.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add explicit sludge stack messaging + counter hint (move, cleanse, step out).
- TODO: add a junction safe pocket that reduces wipe pain.
