# Party Run: q3-sewer-valves / run-10

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: all 4
- classes: fighter, ranger, bard, warlock
- tags: no-healer, risky, wipe-near-miss

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. They go in as a "no-healer" test and play carefully.
2. Valve 2 sludge almost kills them because chip damage accumulates; bard becomes the de facto sustain via pacing and resets.
3. Boss: near-wipe when slick patches overlap with add wave. They survive because they disengage and reset position instead of forcing DPS.
4. Reward: lever pull feels like the right kind of permanent progress.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- bard: pacing and coordination replaces healing.
- fighter: anchors chokes and prevents squishy deletes.
- ranger: threat deletion at range.
- warlock: burst windows; also calls for optional bargain systems.

## Friction / Missing Content

- No-healer parties need at least one explicit safe reset spot (junction) to catch breath.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: mark `R_SEW_JUNC_01` as a safe regroup pocket (no pressure, clear signage).
