# Party Run: q3-sewer-valves / run-08

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 4
- classes: warlock, barbarian, cleric, wizard, bard
- tags: chaotic, bargain-curious, wipe-once

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: warlock asks if there’s a "maintenance daemon" they can bargain with. Barbarian wants to fight a king.
2. Valve rooms: they play messy and burn resources. Bard tries to impose order.
3. Grease King: they wipe once by clumping and sliding into slick patches.
4. Second attempt: they win by calling safe squares and respecting adds.
5. Reward: they pull lever. Warlock tries to bargain for extra shortcut access (future).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- bard: coordination after wipe; makes chaos solvable.
- cleric: stabilizes the messy run; keeps it from collapsing.
- warlock: bargain-curious energy points at optional daemon/keycard systems.
- barbarian: learns discipline; then breaks add wave.
- wizard: control keeps the boss from overwhelming.

## Friction / Missing Content

- If bargains exist, they must be explicit opt-in with loud costs.
- Boss slick patches must remain readable even with lots of visual noise.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an optional "daemon terminal" side beat that trades cost for shortcut (future).
- TODO: ensure slick patch visuals are high contrast and consistent.
