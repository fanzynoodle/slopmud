# Party Run: q3-sewer-valves / run-05

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 4
- classes: bard, cleric, paladin, rogue, druid
- tags: support-heavy, escort-curious, rescue-drone

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they care about "wrong neighborhoods flooding" and treat it as civic work.
2. Junction: immediately focus the broken drone rescue as a "leave no one behind" beat.
3. Valve 2 first: sludge hazard is annoying but survivable with support. They learn to keep moving.
4. Valve 3: rogue scouts grates; bard calls positions; paladin holds.
5. Valve 1: simple objective; druid uses flavor to calm sewer fauna instead of killing everything (optional).
6. Grease King: support-heavy comp makes it safe but slow. They win by staying spread and not chasing.
7. Reward: lever + drone delivered. They want the utility vendor unlock teased.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- bard: coordination and calling valve order; keeps run coherent.
- cleric: status management and sustain through sludge nuisance.
- paladin: escort/protection beat with drone rescue.
- rogue: scouting and valve interactions under pressure.
- druid: nonlethal flavor; wants one explicit "calm fauna" option.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Drone rescue needs explicit "how to carry/calm" UX so it doesn’t feel like escort RNG.
- Druid/nonlethal option needs at least one concrete payoff (reduced spawns, safe pocket).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a calm/carry interaction for the junction drone (class-flexible).
- TODO: add one explicit nonlethal bypass beat (fauna) with a payoff.
