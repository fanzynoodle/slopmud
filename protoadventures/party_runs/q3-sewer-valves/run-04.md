# Party Run: q3-sewer-valves / run-04

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: all 3
- classes: fighter, cleric, wizard
- tags: small-party, resource-tight, slow-and-safe

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they know it’s tuned for 3-5 but accept anyway.
2. Junction: small party feels it immediately; one solver means two holders.
3. Valve order: they do valve 1 first (simple), then valve 2 (sludge), then valve 3 (ranged grates) last when they’ve learned LoS.
4. They rescue the broken drone because they have cleric and want the extra reward later.
5. Grease King: they win, but the arena feels tight for three bodies; one mistake almost wipes them.
6. Reward: lever pull makes them happy; they want a short path back to town after.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: single point of failure; must hold perfectly.
- cleric: sustain and status cleanup; makes small party viable.
- wizard: control and LoS solutions; prevents chain pulls.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Small parties need a clear checkpoint rhythm (reset at junction, or partial progress).
- Boss arena should have at least one safe pocket to regroup without immediate add pressure.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add explicit "safe pocket" in/near junction for regrouping.
- TODO: consider scaling add count in boss arena for party size 3.
