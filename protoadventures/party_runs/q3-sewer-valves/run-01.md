# Party Run: q3-sewer-valves / run-01

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 3/3/3
- classes: fighter, cleric, wizard
- tags: brand-new, balanced, cautious

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the job at the maintenance office because it sounded like the first real dungeon.
   - Bought antidotes and asked what sludge does and how to tell if it is getting worse.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Entered the junction, picked spokes by vibes (north, then west, then east), and used the junction as the reset point.
   - The hub-and-spoke layout read clearly and made backtracking feel intentional instead of confusing.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Valve 1: objective under pressure taught them to protect the wheel-turner.
   - Valve 2: sludge slow punished turtling; they learned to keep moving and not "wait it out".
   - Valve 3: ranged pressure behind grates forced them to respect LoS and corners before committing to the wheel.
4. setpiece / spike
   - The boss gate being sealed was good, but they wanted the sealed message to explicitly say "3 valves".
   - Grease King fight was tense; slick patches taught spread and reposition, but they wanted the cadence to be readable.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They noticed the broken drone but did not rescue it because it read like a trap with unclear benefit.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Lever unlock felt great. They pulled it immediately and wanted explicit "shortcut unlocked" confirmation plus a visible world-change cue.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: anchored valve rooms and peeled adds off the wheel-turner.
- cleric: managed nuisance debuffs and stabilized through hazard cycles.
- wizard: controlled valve-room adds and kept the boss fight readable by calling hazard timings.
- rogue: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Boss gate sealed message needs explicit requirements and a counter: "0/3 valves opened".
- Drone rescue needs a clear "this is optional and safe" framing plus a small benefit so it is not ignored.
- Shortcut unlock needs explicit confirmation text and a visible world-change cue.
- Boss slick patches need consistent telegraphing and cadence so first wipes feel like learning, not RNG.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Make the boss gate sealed message explicit and consistent (include "0/3 valves opened" style copy).
- TODO: Add explicit optional-rescue hinting for the broken drone, plus a small practical payoff (hint, cache, or dialogue change).
- TODO: Add explicit "shortcut unlocked" confirmation and a standard sealed-exit message beyond it (with a one-room teaser).
- TODO: Make slick patch telegraphs and cadence consistent and readable.
