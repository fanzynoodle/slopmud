# Party Run: side-library-misfiled-wing / run-03

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 10/10/10/9/9
- classes: paladin, bard, warlock, barbarian, sorcerer
- tags: loud-shortcut, forbidden-index, chaotic

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Went in for loot and drama. Warlock wanted the forbidden index boon.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Barbarian smashed a jammed shelf wall for a loud shortcut; triggered extra sentinels and made the wing "hot" for the rest of the run.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Mold debuffs stacked because they ignored safe pockets; paid in resources and time.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Warlock accepted a forbidden index boon; escape got harder (extra sentinel wave) and required the party to commit to an explicit cost.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Loud shortcut was obvious and fun; it needs predictable consequences so it feels like a choice, not a random punishment.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Preserved archive and took boon; escaped messy but successful.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: chose preserve despite risk; anchored party choices.
- bard: interpreted hints and reduced wrong-turns under misleading signage.
- warlock: forbidden boon opt-in with explicit cost.
- barbarian: loud shortcut through jammed shelf wall.
- sorcerer: burst sentinel spawns to avoid wipe.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Boon costs must be explicit and capped; stacking costs would feel punitive.
- Loud shortcut consequences must be predictable (what spawns, when, and how you recover).
- Archive choice outcomes must persist (NPC dialogue, future hooks), or it feels like a one-room toggle.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit boon UI (benefit/cost) and cap stacking/duration.
- TODO: Ensure loud shortcut triggers predictable extra waves with clear tells and recovery windows.
- TODO: Make archive choice outcomes persist (quest key, NPC dialogue, future unlock hooks).
