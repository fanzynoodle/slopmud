# Party Run: side-library-misfiled-wing / run-04

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 6/6/6
- classes: fighter, cleric, ranger
- tags: under-leveled, slow-safe, no-vent, destroy-choice

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the antechamber hint literally: "Follow the wrong index marks." Goal was the plate fragment, not the lore.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Played slow in flooded halls. Ranger marked safe pockets; fighter refused to cross deep water until the cleric was ready to cleanse.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Mold stacks felt oppressive at level 6; any misstep in deep water forced a full reset to a safe pocket.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Collapsing stacks puzzle: one wrong step spawned sentinels and nearly wiped them. Fighter held the choke while ranger picked a safe pattern and cleric kept resources from collapsing.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Missed the vent route entirely; no hint and no visible "draft/sound" sign that it existed.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Retrieved fragment, chose destroy to simplify the escape, and got out cleanly. They felt the destroy path is the under-leveled-friendly branch.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger: mapped safe pockets and called the traversal pattern without guessing.
- cleric: mold cleanse timing kept the run moving instead of resetting every mistake.
- fighter: protected the party through sentinel spawns in tight corridors.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Under-leveled parties need stronger teaching for safe pocket language; mistakes are too punishing without it.
- Vent route needs a discoverable hint so it isn't pure luck.
- Preserve/destroy needs a clear payoff statement before the choice (what you gain/lose).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add stronger safe pocket signaling (consistent color, sound, and "safe here" UI ping).
- TODO: Add a vent route hint (draft sound, loose grate visuals, antechamber dialogue).
- TODO: Add explicit preserve/destroy choice UI (reward, escape difficulty, downstream impact).
