# Party Run: side-library-misfiled-wing / run-10

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 8
- classes: paladin
- tags: solo, stubborn, preserve-attempt, switched-to-destroy

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Entered intending to preserve the archive on principle, even solo.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Used safe pockets as checkpoints and refused to fight in deep water; backed off frequently to reset mold stacks.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Sentinel spawns were manageable until the escape phase. Solo sustain was fine, but solo crowd control was limited.
4. setpiece / spike
   - At the vault choice, tried preserve and immediately saw the escape pacing spike. Chose destroy instead so the solo escape stayed fair.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Missed vent route; without it, solo routing felt like a slow trudge between safe pockets.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Escaped with fragment but without lore. The run proved the choice prompt needs clear "solo/small party" guidance.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: disciplined safe-pocket play; treated deep water as a hard fail condition.
- paladin: made the branch choice deliberately based on party capability, not vibes.
- paladin: held the escape choke long enough to reset and finish, despite limited solo control.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Choice prompt should provide clear guidance for solo/small parties about escape difficulty.
- Vent route needs hinting; solo without it feels like punishment rather than challenge.
- Preserve escape pacing might need party_size scaling so the "right" choice isn't locked out of solo.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add preserve/destroy choice guidance by party size (solo/duo vs full group).
- TODO: Add stronger vent route hinting so solo players can plan.
- TODO: Add party_size scaling for preserve-escape sentinel pacing.
