# Party Run: side-library-misfiled-wing / run-07

## Party

- size: 2
- levels: 9/9
- classes: rogue, monk
- tags: duo, vent-route, stealth, preserve

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Entered for the fragment and wanted to preserve the archive if the duo escape lane existed.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Found the vent route early and used it to bypass the flooded lock; treated deep water as "never unless forced."
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Avoided most sentinels by staying quiet. Mold stacks still mattered; one mistake forced a full reset to a safe pocket because they had no cleanse.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Archive puzzle: rogue read the pattern, monk handled traversal resets. Preserve choice turned escape into "stay hidden while moving fast."
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Vent route was the secret; it made the duo preserve choice viable.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Preserved and escaped cleanly by committing to stealth and safe pockets. Duo felt fair as long as the stealth lane is consistent.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- rogue: vent bypass and puzzle pattern reading under time pressure.
- monk: traversal mastery and resets when the duo got boxed in by sentinels.
- rogue/monk: executed stealth escape routing without relying on cleanse or brute force.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Stealth lane needs consistent rules (what breaks it, how long it lasts) so duo plans are reliable.
- Vent route hinting is still too subtle; this run succeeded because they got lucky early.
- Preserve escape needs clear "safe pockets" even for stealth parties, or one mistake becomes a wipe.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit stealth-lane rules and tells (alertness meter, sound cues).
- TODO: Add vent route hints earlier (antechamber note or environmental draft audio).
- TODO: Add a predictable safe pocket near the preserve escape start so duos can reset once.
