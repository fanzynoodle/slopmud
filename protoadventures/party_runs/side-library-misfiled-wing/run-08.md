# Party Run: side-library-misfiled-wing / run-08

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 8/8/8/8
- classes: barbarian, paladin, bard, druid
- tags: loud-shortcut, mold-stacks, preserve, decision-heavy

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Came for the fragment, but paladin framed the run as "we don't destroy knowledge just because it's dangerous."
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Barbarian opened a loud shelf-wall shortcut to avoid extra flooded halls. It saved time but triggered extra sentinels immediately.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Mold stacks punished the loud route because the fights dragged in deep water pockets. Druid had to keep the party from sprinting into mold.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Chose preserve. Escape was harder but felt like a coherent consequence: more sentinels, fewer safe pauses.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Loud shelf-wall shortcut was obvious and fun, but it needs predictable escalation rules.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Preserved and escaped messy. The choice felt meaningful, but only because the consequences were visible.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: loud shortcut opener that changed the whole route.
- paladin: preserve choice despite risk; anchored the party's decision.
- bard: kept navigation coherent when wrong signage was intentionally misleading.
- druid: managed mold pacing and kept the party out of deep water during fights.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Loud shortcut needs deterministic consequences (exactly what spawns/when), not random piles.
- Mold stack UI needs to be loud enough that players stop sprinting into deep water.
- Preserve/destroy needs downstream impact callouts so it isn't just "harder/easier escape."

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Define loud shortcut escalation rules (spawn count, timing, recovery window) and communicate them.
- TODO: Improve mold stack readability and add a clear "safe pocket" cleanse/decay behavior.
- TODO: Add downstream impact hooks for preserve (NPC dialogue, future unlock) and destroy (different hook).
