# Party Run: side-library-misfiled-wing / run-09

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 7/7/7/7/7
- classes: barbarian, fighter, rogue, wizard, sorcerer
- tags: no-cleanse, greedy, destroy, speed

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Wanted the fragment and planned to "get in and out" before mold stacks mattered.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Took the most direct flooded route and tried to brute through because they had no cleanse and assumed speed would substitute.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Speed didn't help when a wrong step spawned sentinels in the stacks room; fighting in mold pockets forced a hard reset twice.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Archive puzzle was solved quickly by wizard, but the party chose destroy immediately to keep the escape manageable without cleanse.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Missed vent route; it would have solved half their pain, but there was no hint to look for it.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Got fragment and escaped, but it felt like the wing is tuned around having a cleanse or having a vent bypass.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: puzzle solve and control during sentinel spawns.
- rogue: read traversal patterns and prevented additional wrong-step spawns.
- fighter/barbarian: held the choke when the party had to reset in a tight corridor.
- sorcerer: burst-cleared sentinel spikes to buy movement windows.

## Friction / Missing Content

- No-cleanse parties need a clearer "viable route" (vent, more safe pockets, or faster mold decay).
- Vent route hinting is too weak; missing it turns the run into attrition misery.
- Destroy choice needs a clear statement that it is the safer branch for no-cleanse parties.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a no-cleanse route option (more safe pockets, vent hint, or mold decay tuning).
- TODO: Add a strong vent route teach moment (draft audio, visual cue, antechamber note).
- TODO: Add explicit branch guidance in the preserve/destroy prompt for different party types.
