# Party Run: side-library-misfiled-wing / run-02

## Party

- size: 2
- levels: 7/7
- classes: monk, ranger
- tags: small-party, navigation, no-cleanse

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Went in for the fragment; planned to avoid fights and learn the wing.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Ranger mapped safe pockets in flooded halls; monk handled traversal and resets.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Without cleanse, mold stacks forced them to play slow and respect safe pockets. One mistake meant backing out and waiting for stacks to decay.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Collapsing stacks nearly wiped them; monk used movement to reset and ranger picked off sentinels while staying out of deep water lanes.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Missed vent route; didn't know it existed and had no hint to search for it.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Chose destroy to make escape easier; got fragment but lost lore reward.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger: mapped the wing and found the real exit under pressure.
- monk: traversal mastery through collapsing stacks and safe-pocket resets.
- monk/ranger: executed a no-cleanse plan without turning it into random attrition.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Small parties need a fair preserve escape route (or scaling) if they choose preserve.
- Vent route needs better hinting so it isn't pure luck.
- Safe pocket language must be visible from range; otherwise duos lose time and die to mold.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add hint for vent route (draft, sound, graffiti, antechamber dialogue).
- TODO: Ensure safe pocket language is visible from range (consistent color/sound).
- TODO: Make preserve escape difficulty fair for small parties (party_size scaling or alternate lane).
