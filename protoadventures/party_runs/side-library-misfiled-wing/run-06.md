# Party Run: side-library-misfiled-wing / run-06

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 9/9/9/9/9
- classes: wizard, sorcerer, warlock, cleric, bard
- tags: all-caster, forbidden-index-boon, preserve, sentinel-swarm

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Went in for fragment + lore key, and agreed to take a forbidden index boon if it was explicit and optional.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Used safe pockets as "staging rooms": clear, cleanse, then push. Bard kept the group moving and prevented over-dwelling in mold.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Flooded halls were manageable because cleric cleansed early and often, but they still got punished when they tried to sprint through deep water to save time.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Took the forbidden index boon and preserved the archive. Escape became a sentinel swarm; wizard controlled lanes while sorcerer burst the waves and warlock chose when to spend the risky power.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Missed vent route because they never scouted off the main path; too focused on boon/preserve consequences.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Successful preserve + boon run with a hard escape. It was fun because the costs were clear; it would be awful if the boon cost was surprising.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- cleric: mold cleanse pacing made flooded navigation viable for the whole group.
- bard: kept the party from getting lost in wrong signage and maintained cohesion under pressure.
- wizard: lane control in the preserve escape; prevented sentinel waves from becoming chaos.
- sorcerer: burst timing on wave spikes; made the swarm survivable.
- warlock: opted into the boon cost and managed the tradeoff rather than treating it as free power.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Boon UI must be explicit and capped; stacking costs would make this feel punitive.
- Sentinel wave pacing needs clear "wave start/end" so players can reset in safe pockets.
- Vent route needs hinting so parties can deliberately plan escape lanes.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit boon UI (benefit/cost/duration) and cap stacking or re-taking.
- TODO: Add clear sentinel wave pacing cues (audio sting, UI bar) so escape is learnable.
- TODO: Add consistent vent route hints (draft sound, grate visuals) to support planned routing.
