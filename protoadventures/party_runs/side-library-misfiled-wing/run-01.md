# Party Run: side-library-misfiled-wing / run-01

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 8/8/8/8
- classes: fighter, cleric, wizard, rogue
- tags: first-time, debuffs, vent-route

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took hint from antechamber: "follow wrong index marks."
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Used vent route to bypass a flooded lock.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Mold stacks punished standing in deep water; cleric cleanse mattered and created real pacing choices.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Collapsing stacks puzzle spawned sentinels when they guessed wrong; wizard controlled while rogue read pattern and fighter held the tight choke.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Vent route felt like a real reward for scouting, not a random secret.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Retrieved fragment and preserved the archive; escape was harder but doable.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- rogue: vent bypass and traversal/puzzle pattern reading.
- cleric: cleansed mold debuffs and kept party functional through flooded segments.
- wizard: solved warded archive puzzle and controlled sentinel spawns.
- fighter: protected the team in tight corridors while debuffs stacked.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Debuff telegraphs must be loud (stacks, thresholds, cleanse messaging).
- Traversal puzzle needs consistent tells to avoid "guess and die."
- Preserve/destroy choice needs an explicit prompt that states payoff and escape difficulty.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add strong mold debuff telegraph + clear cleanse messaging.
- TODO: Make traversal tells consistent (visual + audio), with a safe recovery step after one mistake.
- TODO: Ensure preserve/destroy choice is explicit, meaningful, and persistent.
