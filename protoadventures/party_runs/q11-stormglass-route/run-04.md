# Party Run: q11-stormglass-route / run-04

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 13
- classes: wizard, cleric, warlock, sorcerer, bard
- tags: all-casters, lore-hounds, cautious

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they treat it as a survival rite. Bard extracts lore about "stormglass" and why the eye forms.
2. Dunes: wizard control + sorcerer burst trivialize many fights, but pulses still punish mistakes.
3. Bargain: warlock accepts an optional storm boon (faster progress) that adds a "storm debt" token (pulses hit harder later).
4. Glassfields: cleric becomes MVP cleansing attrition and keeping the party stable.
5. Storm eye: they win first try by respecting lull windows and controlling add waves.
6. Resolution: bargains are fun if costs are explicit and capped.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: turns navigation and combat into solvable problems.
- cleric: sustains through attrition pulses; makes hazards tolerable.
- bard: cadence caller; coordinates lull windows and morale.
- warlock: optional boon adds risk texture and story.
- sorcerer: burst deletes storm-eye add windows.
- fighter/rogue/ranger/paladin/druid/barbarian/monk: absent; see TODOs.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Bargain UX must be loud: token count, next consequence, paydown options.
- Need a clear "storm debt" payoff and cap; otherwise it’s just punishment.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: codify storm boon bargains (max debt, escalating cost, paydown).
- TODO: add 1-2 lore objects in shelters to reward curiosity.
