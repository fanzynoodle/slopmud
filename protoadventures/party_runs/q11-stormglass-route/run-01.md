# Party Run: q11-stormglass-route / run-01

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 13
- classes: fighter, cleric, wizard, rogue, ranger
- tags: balanced, first-time, methodical

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: the outpost wants a route opened through the wastes. The storm eye is the only window. Get in, do the thing, get out.
2. Prep: they buy water and "heat cloth" equivalents, agree on a rule: "never fight in the open during a storm pulse."
3. Dunes: long traversal with ranged pressure. Ranger picks threats, rogue scouts cover pockets, fighter keeps the party cohesive.
4. Glassfields: navigation hazard. Wizard becomes the map tool; cleric handles attrition debuffs.
5. Secret: they find a half-buried shelter tube that lets them skip a nasty open segment (feels like survival skill reward).
6. Storm eye approach: visibility drops. They learn to move on "lull windows" and stop in shelters.
7. Setpiece: storm eye event. They must stabilize a beacon/marker while waves arrive in a fixed cadence.
8. Boss-like spike: the storm manifests as a phase shift; adds + hazard. They wipe once, then win by prioritizing adds and respecting the storm rhythm.
9. Resolution: they return with a stamped route token; outpost opens the next gate.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: keeps the party from splitting during low visibility; anchors safe pockets.
- rogue: finds the shelter tube and scouts cover; prevents storm-pulse wipes.
- cleric: sustains through attrition and cleanses storm debuffs.
- wizard: navigation and control; turns glassfields into a solvable puzzle.
- ranger: threat removal at range in wide dunes; picks off pressure units early.
- paladin: no paladin; would shine in "carry the weak" rescue beat.
- bard: no bard; would shine coordinating lull windows and morale under attrition.
- druid: no druid; would shine interacting with storms/desert ecology.
- barbarian: no barbarian; would shine forcing open a buried shelter door under pressure.
- warlock: no warlock; would shine in optional storm boon bargains.
- sorcerer: no sorcerer; would shine bursting storm-eye add windows.
- monk: no monk; would shine in hazard dodging and fast traversal.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need consistent storm telegraphs (audio + text) and an explicit "lull window" language.
- Navigation needs readable landmarks; otherwise dunes become arbitrary.
- Shelter pockets must be clearly described as safe from pulses.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: standardize storm pulse + lull window messaging.
- TODO: codify shelter tubes as the zone’s secret (consistent tells + payoff).
