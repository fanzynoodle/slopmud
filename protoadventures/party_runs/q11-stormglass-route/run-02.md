# Party Run: q11-stormglass-route / run-02

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: all 12 (under-leveled)
- classes: barbarian, monk, sorcerer
- tags: under-leveled, no-healer, speedrun

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they want the gate unlock fast. Plan: sprint dunes, burst setpiece, leave.
2. Dunes: speed fails during a storm pulse. Barbarian fights in the open and gets punished; no-healer makes the run fragile.
3. Glassfields: monk becomes the run leader, calling safe lines and keeping them moving.
4. Shelter: they miss the intended shelter and nearly wipe. They learn shelter discovery is mandatory for this comp.
5. Storm eye: they attempt setpiece with low resources and fail once. Second attempt: they wait out lull windows and it works (teachable).
6. Extraction: they leave without attempting optional spike; success feels earned but harsh.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: brute force and panic button; also the biggest liability in open storms.
- monk: traversal mastery; turns hazard routing into a rhythm.
- sorcerer: burst windows delete add waves and save the run.
- cleric/wizard/ranger/rogue/fighter: absent; their absence defines fragility.
- paladin/bard/druid/warlock: absent; see TODOs.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need explicit warning: storms punish open fights; provide safer alternate route for under-leveled/no-healer.
- Need a mid-run safe pocket so wipes aren’t full re-clear pain.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an outpost checkpoint unlock halfway through the dunes.
- TODO: add a "slow safe route" that trades time for more shelters and fewer open pulses.
