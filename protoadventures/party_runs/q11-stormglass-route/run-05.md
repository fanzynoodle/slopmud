# Party Run: q11-stormglass-route / run-05

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: all 16 (over-leveled)
- classes: fighter, cleric, ranger, wizard
- tags: over-leveled, bored-test, efficient

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they do it for unlock chain; expect to faceroll.
2. Combat: mobs melt, but pulses still matter. Geometry beats level.
3. Storm eye: the only interesting part is phase rhythm and add windows.
4. Resolution: they want optional hard mode (extra objective, elite storm phase) for better rewards.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger: still shines on long sightlines; prevents chain pulls.
- wizard: turns storms into rhythm; solves navigation.
- fighter/cleric: safety net.
- others: absent; needs optional bite.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Not enough optional difficulty for over-leveled parties.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an optional "hard eye" objective behind a risk lever for better rewards.
- TODO: add a boss shield phase tied to add control so DPS can’t skip mechanics.
