# Party Run: q11-stormglass-route / run-03

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 13
- classes: fighter, paladin, barbarian, monk, rogue
- tags: all-melee, stubborn, hazard-respect

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: paladin frames it as escorting a route for future travelers. Everyone agrees: "fight only in cover."
2. Dunes: ranged threats are annoying. They adapt by pulling into shelter pockets and fighting in short bursts.
3. Glassfields: melee gets punished if they chase too far. Monk and rogue start calling "return to cover" as the core rule.
4. Secret: rogue finds a buried shelter hatch and it becomes the melee-friendly route.
5. Storm eye setpiece: they win by treating the event as positioning discipline, not damage.
6. Resolution: melee is viable if cover pockets are frequent and obvious.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: keeps the party cohesive; anchors cover fights.
- paladin: defensive escort and moral framing; protects during pulses.
- barbarian: brute force when cover fails; hero moment forcing a hatch open.
- monk: hazard routing and movement discipline.
- rogue: shelter discovery and scouting under low visibility.
- cleric/wizard/ranger/bard/druid/warlock/sorcerer: absent; see TODOs.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Melee needs consistent lure tools so far threats come to cover.
- Cover pockets must be clearly described; otherwise storms feel unfair.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a consistent lure tool (flare/noise) to pull threats into shelter zones.
- TODO: add strong cover vocabulary in room descriptions (ribs, panels, tubes).
