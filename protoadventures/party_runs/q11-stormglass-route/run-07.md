# Party Run: q11-stormglass-route / run-07

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 13
- classes: bard, paladin, druid, fighter, rogue
- tags: social-builds, rescue-first, roleplay-heavy

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they insist on escorting a small caravan segment, not just doing the objective. "People matter."
2. Outpost: bard negotiates for a "shelter key" that opens one sealed tube (future rep hook).
3. Dunes: they prioritize rescues, pulling threats away from the caravan and fighting only in cover pockets.
4. Druid interacts with desert life and storms: sometimes calms threats, sometimes fails and triggers fights.
5. Storm eye: they attempt to "treaty" the storm by stabilizing a marker without killing everything. It mostly fails, but changes the event rhythm into something more readable (would be a cool feature).
6. Resolution: they want explicit support for rescue-first and nonlethal play (rep, shortcuts, services).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- bard: negotiations and cadence; keeps the caravan moving on lull windows.
- paladin: moral anchor; protection during pulses.
- druid: signature beat: interact with storm/desert ecology.
- fighter: escorts and holds cover pockets under pressure.
- rogue: shelter access and scouting.
- cleric/wizard/ranger/barbarian/warlock/sorcerer/monk: absent.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Nonlethal/rescue choices need clear rewards and signaling.
- The caravan escort needs a simple mechanic so it feels real (pace, protection, failure states).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an optional caravan escort sub-objective with explicit rewards.
- TODO: define a "treaty attempt" trigger: fails but changes storm-eye rhythm.
