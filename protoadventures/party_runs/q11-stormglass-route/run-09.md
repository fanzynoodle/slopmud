# Party Run: q11-stormglass-route / run-09

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 13
- classes: ranger, ranger, rogue, monk, sorcerer
- tags: ranged-heavy, fast-clear, timing-first

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they speedrun the route unlock.
2. Dunes: ranger duo deletes pressure units early; monk calls lull windows; rogue scouts shelters.
3. Glassfields: they treat it like a navigation race; they never stop in open pulses.
4. Secret: they find the shelter tube and use it to shave time and risk.
5. Storm eye: sorcerer burst trivializes add windows; they win first try.
6. Resolution: they want a clean-clear reward hook (cosmetic/token/rep).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- rangers: long sightline control; prevent snowball pulls.
- rogue: shelter discovery and route shaving.
- monk: cadence caller for pulses; turns storm into rhythm.
- sorcerer: burst deletes storm-eye add windows.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a consistent penalty for fighting in open pulses (alert/attrition escalation).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define a wastes "exposure meter" that escalates if you fight in open pulses.
- TODO: add a perfect-clear reward hook.
