# Party Run: q11-stormglass-route / run-06

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: all 12 (under-leveled)
- classes: paladin, rogue, cleric
- tags: under-leveled, cautious, no-caster

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: paladin frames it as "open the route so people don’t die." Rogue wants shelters; cleric wants stability.
2. Dunes: slow, careful pulls into cover. Rogue scouts; they never fight in open pulses.
3. Secret: rogue finds a shelter tube route that cuts risk dramatically.
4. Glassfields: navigation is the threat. They mark landmarks and move only on lulls.
5. Storm eye: two attempts. They win by prioritizing adds and using paladin defensive windows during pulses.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: defensive escort and moral anchor; makes attrition feel like a vow.
- rogue: shelter discovery and navigation under low visibility.
- cleric: sustain and cleanse; without it run fails.
- wizard/ranger/sorcerer: absent; far threats are harder without ranged tools.
- fighter/monk/bard/druid/barbarian/warlock: absent.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Wipe recovery is demoralizing without a safe pocket.
- Need explicit lure tools for far threats into cover.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an outpost safe pocket unlock after reaching the glassfields.
- TODO: add a reusable lure tool (flare/noise) that pulls threats into shelter zones.
