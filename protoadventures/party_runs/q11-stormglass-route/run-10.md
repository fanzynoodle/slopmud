# Party Run: q11-stormglass-route / run-10

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 13
- classes: warlock, barbarian, cleric, wizard, bard
- tags: bargain-heavy, chaotic, wipe-once

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: warlock wants storm boons; barbarian wants to fight the storm; bard wants the story.
2. Dunes: wizard control keeps them alive until barbarian fights in an open pulse and gets punished.
3. Bargain: warlock takes a storm boon bargain. Faster progress, but pulses hit harder later (storm debt).
4. They ignore the cost and wipe once in glassfields when pulses stack with an add wave.
5. Regroup: bard sets rules, cleric stabilizes, wizard navigates. They cap bargains to one more.
6. Storm eye: they win by saving burst/control for add windows and respecting lull windows.
7. Resolution: bargains are fun if costs are explicit, capped, and persistent (debt tokens).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- warlock: optional boon system’s poster child; adds risk texture.
- barbarian: chaos agent, then add clearer; learns discipline.
- cleric: sustain and pulse recovery after wipe.
- wizard: navigation and control; converts chaos into solvable phases.
- bard: coordination and cadence are the win condition.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Bargain UX must be loud: token count, next consequence, paydown options.
- Need a mid-run safe pocket so wipes don’t require full re-clear.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: codify storm boon rules: max debt, escalating cost, paydown options.
- TODO: add a safe pocket near the storm eye approach.
