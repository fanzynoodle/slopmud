# Party Run: event-rail-runaway-cargo-bot / run-02

## Party

- size: 2
- levels: 7/7
- classes: monk, rogue
- tags: fast, lever-route, no-heal

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Treated it like a speedrun: "lever then weak points."
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Monk took the high route to the lever platform; rogue stayed low to avoid yard hazards.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Lever pull spawned an ambush; rogue had to kite while monk finished the interact.
4. setpiece / spike
   - At the stop point, they couldn't body-block. They won by hitting weak points and dodging the ram charge.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found a ladder chain that bypassed one yard hazard segment; it felt like the intended small-party speed lane.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Clean stop, no terminal damage; got a better payout despite small party.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- monk: movement mastery to reach lever fast under timer.
- rogue: lever route execution + weak point targeting under pressure.
- monk/rogue: survived the ambush tradeoff without losing the timer.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Small parties need a viable "no heal" lane: lever + dodge + weak points.
- Ambush after lever needs a clear spawn pattern so it feels fair.
- Weak points must remain visually loud while sprinting and dodging hazards.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit small-party guidance in dispatcher text (lever route + weak points).
- TODO: Make lever ambush pattern predictable and readable (spawn tells).
- TODO: Keep weak points visually loud for fast parties (outline/shimmer).
