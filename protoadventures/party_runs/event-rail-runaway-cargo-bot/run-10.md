# Party Run: event-rail-runaway-cargo-bot / run-10

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 8
- classes: monk
- tags: solo, speedrun, lever-route, perfect-dodge

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Treated it as a movement trial: "hit lever, hit weak points, never get clipped."
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Took the lever platform immediately, then used a ladder chain to rejoin the line ahead of the bot.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Lever ambush was avoided by spacing and movement; they didn't try to clear it, only survive long enough to complete the interact.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Final stop: dodged the ram tell, then punished weak points during the safe window. No body-block needed.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - The ladder chain shortcut made the run work. Without it, the monk would have been forced into more hazard lanes.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Clean stop with no terminal damage. It felt great when the route was readable and awful when hazards lacked lane telegraphs.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- monk: lever interact under timer pressure while avoiding the ambush.
- monk: executed the ladder chain shortcut to skip a hazard segment.
- monk: perfect-dodged the ram window and finished weak points without getting clipped.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Solo speed lanes need consistent signage; otherwise it becomes memorization-only.
- Lever interact needs a clear success/fail feedback so solos know they "got it" while sprinting.
- Hazard lane telegraphs must be clear enough to read at full speed.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add consistent speed-lane signage for ladders/catwalks.
- TODO: Add loud lever interact feedback (sound + UI ping) on success.
- TODO: Add high-contrast hazard lane markers that remain readable while sprinting.
