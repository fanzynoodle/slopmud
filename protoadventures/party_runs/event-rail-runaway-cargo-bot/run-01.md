# Party Run: event-rail-runaway-cargo-bot / run-01

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 6/6/6
- classes: fighter, wizard, cleric
- tags: first-time, time-pressure, body-block

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Dispatcher yelled "runaway on the line"; party sprinted out of the terminal without prepping.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Chased along the main line, ignoring the lever route at first.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Yard geometry clipped them twice; fighter learned to lead and call safe lanes.
   - Wizard slowed the bot once, but it wasn't enough without a second slowdown.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Fighter body-blocked the bot at the stop point while cleric kept them alive.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Missed the emergency lever on the first pass; learned it exists only after wipe-level pressure.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Stopped the bot with terminal barely intact; got base payout.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: hero moment body-blocking the bot under time pressure.
- wizard: slow/control mattered when used at the right time, not on cooldown.
- cleric: kept the run alive when geometry mistakes stacked.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Timer needs to be loud; "distance to terminal" must be obvious.
- Lever route should be signposted earlier so parties don't learn it by failure.
- Geometry hazards need clear lane indicators so clips feel fair.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit timer UI + audio callouts ("distance to terminal").
- TODO: Improve signage for lever route vs straight chase.
- TODO: Add consistent hazard lane telegraphs in yard and stop point.
