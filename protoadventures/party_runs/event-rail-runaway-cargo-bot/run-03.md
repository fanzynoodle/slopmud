# Party Run: event-rail-runaway-cargo-bot / run-03

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 8/8/8/7/7
- classes: barbarian, warlock, ranger, bard, paladin
- tags: rescue-bystanders, bargain, chaotic

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Paladin insisted on rescuing bystanders even if it risked the terminal.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Split roles: ranger/warlock did slows; barbarian planned to grapple at the stop point; bard called cadence to keep the group from scattering.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Yard hazards were easy with a full party, but rescue cost time and forced them into bad lanes.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Warlock overcharged brakes (bargain): big slow, but spawned an extra elite pack.
   - Barbarian grappled/body-blocked the bot while bard coordinated and paladin protected the bystander lane.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Ignored a ladder shortcut; rescue path already ate time and they couldn't afford exploration.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Saved bystanders, stopped the bot late; terminal took damage but event still succeeded.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: rescue vs speed moral beat (explicit opt-in).
- barbarian: grapple/body-block hero moment under timer pressure.
- warlock: bargain tradeoff created real tension (slow now, pay later).
- ranger: weak point targeting and slows while moving.
- bard: coordination under a timer prevented panic splitting.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Rescue cost needs explicit presentation so parties knowingly opt in.
- Overcharge bargain must be explicit and capped; surprise elites can feel cheap.
- Terminal damage state should be communicated immediately (success but degraded).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit rescue optional objective UI (count, distance, time cost).
- TODO: Make bargain costs/benefits clear and bounded (cap stacking).
- TODO: Ensure terminal damage state is communicated with clear consequences and messaging.
