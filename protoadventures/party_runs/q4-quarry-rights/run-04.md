# Party Run: q4-quarry-rights / run-04

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 5/5/5/6/6
- classes: ranger, wizard, sorcerer, warlock, cleric
- tags: all-ranged, tempo-play, interrupt-focus

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the quest because the illegal dig sounded like a clean setpiece and the checkpoint pass is a visible unlock.
   - Wanted to know if the ore mask matters here or is just flavor.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Played pits like a firing line. Used cover sparingly and kept pulls small.
   - Returned to the shack once to restock before Breaker-7.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Worm ambush became a lesson beat: the ranger called tells, and the wizard pre-positioned.
   - Illegal dig: nets were the only scary part. Once counterplay messaging existed, the party adapted fast.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Choice room: they wanted the summary to be short and the confirm step to be explicit, not implied.
   - Breaker-7: slow slam was a joke at range, shove was still relevant because it threatened positioning. They wanted shove to have a clear "brace or be displaced" cue.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - No secret found. They asked for a single optional side tunnel that adds a risk/reward decision (shorter route, harder pack).
6. resolution / rewards
   - Gatehouse acknowledgement line made the choice feel real.
   - Checkpoint pass felt like the actual reward; they immediately tried to go north.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger: called worm tells and route-led the pits cleanly.
- wizard: used area denial to keep illegal dig flanks from collapsing.
- sorcerer: deleted net-throwers and prevented panic cascades.
- warlock: took interrupt duty and maintained tempo by ending packs quickly.
- cleric: handled heavy hits and taught "heal under pressure" as the baseline.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Breaker-7 shove needs a clearer telegraph and a clear counterplay story so it is not a hidden check.
- The choice prompt should be fast to read in text-only, especially for parties that want to keep moving.
- The quarry needs one optional secret/shortcut so it is not purely linear combat.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a distinct shove cue and one-line counterplay hint for Breaker-7.
- TODO: Keep the choice summary to 3 lines and require explicit confirm.
- TODO: Add one optional side tunnel with risk/reward.
