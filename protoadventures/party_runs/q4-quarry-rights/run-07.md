# Party Run: q4-quarry-rights / run-07

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 4/5/5/6
- classes: paladin, bard, fighter, rogue
- tags: roleplay-heavy, choice-focus, no-caster

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Treated the foreman shack like a negotiation scene, not a quest kiosk.
   - Asked whether the union rep and foreman are both credible and what each one is afraid of.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Moved cautiously through pits and kept pulls small.
   - Rogue tried to find proof before fighting, but the dig setpiece forced commitment (fine).
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Heavy hits taught resource management without a caster toolkit.
   - Worm ambush: strong first-time telegraph worked; afterwards they respected the ground tells.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Illegal dig: nets landed; the party learned counterplay quickly once messaging was explicit.
   - Choice room: they wanted a third "neutral clerk" option, even if it resolves to one side mechanically.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They found no secret. Requested a small hidden document stash that changes dialogue, not rewards.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Breaker-7: shove was legible once they treated edges as dangerous; they used brace/disrupt counterplay.
   - Gatehouse acknowledgement line mattered; it made the choice feel persistent.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: carried the moral weight of the choice and insisted it be confirmed and logged.
- bard: de-escalated the choice room argument and extracted better summaries from NPCs.
- fighter: anchored pits pulls and peeled nets during the dig.
- rogue: scouted, found ground tells, and made the party feel clever rather than lucky.
- cleric: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- The choice room needs a way to roleplay "neutral" without adding a third major branch (a dialogue option that still maps to union/foreman is fine).
- A lore-only secret that affects dialogue would improve replay and reduce purely combat feel.
- Nets must have consistent counterplay text and timing so the lesson sticks.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a "neutral framing" dialogue option in the choice room that still resolves to union/foreman.
- TODO: Add a lore-only secret stash that changes one NPC line later.
- TODO: Ensure net counterplay messaging is consistent and only tutorialized once.
