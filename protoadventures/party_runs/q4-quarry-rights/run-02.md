# Party Run: q4-quarry-rights / run-02

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 4/4/4
- classes: barbarian, rogue, warlock
- tags: under-leveled, no-healer, greedy, bot-fill-optional

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Accepted because they wanted access to the checkpoint road, not because they cared about the dispute.
   - Asked where to get consumables and whether the foreman crate is enough to stock up.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Overpulled in pits once and had to retreat. They wanted a clear retreat story that doesn't feel like a reset.
   - Treated the foreman room as a "restock node" and returned once before the elite.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Worm ambush hit hard without a healer. They requested a way to mitigate it (mask, stance, or a warning that lets you avoid).
   - Illegal dig: net-throwers almost ended the run. They learned to focus them, but only after a near wipe.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Choice room was treated as flavor. They chose foreman because it sounded like fewer complications.
   - Breaker-7: they wiped once. The shove mechanic was the killer; they could not tell where it would throw them.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They found a side tunnel that looked like a shortcut (if we add one), but it was sealed. They wanted that to be a future unlock.
6. resolution / rewards
   - With an assist bot (medic or vanguard), the content felt fair for a trio. Without it, it felt like attrition.
   - They still liked the "earned pass" loop and wanted the checkpoint to feel like a real gate.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: saved the run after a bad net pull by deleting throwers fast.
- rogue: learned the worm tell and started calling out ground cues.
- warlock: traded health for tempo and carried damage when the party was collapsing.
- fighter: none
- cleric: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Trio + no-healer needs a clear recovery loop: restock node, consumables, and/or bot fill to trio minimum.
- Breaker-7 shove needs a clearer telegraph and safe counterplay (positioning, brace, or interrupt window).
- Choice should still be acknowledged even if the party doesn't care, so it doesn't feel fake.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Make the foreman shack an explicit restock node (cheap consumables and one hint about nets).
- TODO: Add clearer telegraph/counterplay for Breaker-7 shove.
- TODO: Add bot-fill boundary suggestion before Breaker-7 if fewer than 3 humans.
