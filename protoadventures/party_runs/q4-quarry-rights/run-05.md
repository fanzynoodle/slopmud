# Party Run: q4-quarry-rights / run-05

## Party

- size: 3 (2 humans + 1 assist bot)
- levels: 4/5/5
- classes: fighter, wizard, bot:medic
- tags: bot-fill, two-humans, speedrun, low-sustain

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Accepted quickly and immediately restocked at the shack.
   - Assumed the game would bot-fill them to trio minimum (it did).
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Rushed pits and ate one worm ambush because they did not respect tells.
   - Reset pace after that and treated pits as "pull small, move fast".
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Illegal dig: bot sustain prevented a wipe after nets landed. Humans handled the actual counterplay.
   - Choice: they wanted the confirm step because only two humans were discussing it.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Breaker-7: they used the slow slam as a reposition window. Shove mattered, and they learned to stay off edges.
   - They wanted the arena to have a clear "danger edge" hint (fall, crush, or hazard).
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Skipped secrets to keep tempo.
6. resolution / rewards
   - The checkpoint pass + gatehouse line were satisfying.
   - They wanted a one-room teaser north of the gatehouse that is sealed for now, to make the unlock feel immediate.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: anchored pits pulls and peeled nets off the wizard.
- wizard: solved dig flanks and kept the room from snowballing when nets landed.
- bot:medic: provided predictable sustain without solving objectives.
- cleric: none
- rogue: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Assist bots must not handle choice prompts or complex mechanics by default.
- The Breaker-7 arena needs a clear spatial story (edges matter, shove matters) so displacement is legible.
- The checkpoint unlock should have an immediate teaser, even if midgame road is sealed in early builds.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Ensure bots do not act in choice rooms and do not solve counterplay mechanics.
- TODO: Add a clear arena edge/hazard hint so shove counterplay is legible.
- TODO: Add an optional sealed teaser exit north of the gatehouse (future midgame road).
