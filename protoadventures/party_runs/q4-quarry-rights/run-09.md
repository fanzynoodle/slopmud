# Party Run: q4-quarry-rights / run-09

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 6/6/6/6/6
- classes: barbarian, fighter, cleric, ranger, sorcerer
- tags: over-leveled, hard-mode-on, loot-hunters

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the job specifically to test the optional hard mode.
   - Asked what the hard mode changes and what the reward is (needs to be clear and modest).
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Cleared pits fast, but wanted one optional side tunnel to justify exploration even when over-leveled.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Worm ambush was irrelevant for them. They wanted a secondary consequence for ignoring tells (separation, dropped item, or time loss).
   - Illegal dig: nets were still meaningful because they disrupt tempo.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Hard mode Breaker-7 was fun if it added one extra pattern or tightened windows, not just HP.
   - They wanted the hard mode toggle to be opt-in and clearly logged so parties can compare runs.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found none. Suggested the side tunnel be a high-risk shortcut with a small lore or cosmetic payoff.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Gatehouse acknowledgement was fine. They wanted the checkpoint pass to print one extra "hard mode token" line if enabled.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: took the hard mode risk and held tempo when patterns tightened.
- fighter: anchored pits pulls and made nets manageable via quick peel play.
- cleric: kept the party aggressive by enabling safe mistakes.
- ranger: route-led and called worm tells even when they didn't matter (good for teaching).
- sorcerer: burst down net-throwers to prevent disruption cascades.
- rogue: none
- wizard: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- warlock: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Hard mode needs explicit "what changes" and "what you get" messaging, and it must be modest so it's not mandatory.
- Over-leveled parties need at least one exploration payoff (side tunnel, lore, or cosmetic token).
- Worm ambush could have a non-damage consequence to keep it relevant at higher level.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Define hard mode delta and modest reward in one sentence each.
- TODO: Add a side tunnel or exploration payoff for over-leveled parties.
- TODO: Consider a non-damage worm consequence variant for over-leveled parties.
