# Party Run: q4-quarry-rights / run-01

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 4/4/5/5
- classes: fighter, cleric, rogue, wizard
- tags: brand-new, balanced, cautious

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the job from the foreman because "checkpoint access" sounded like progression.
   - Asked what an "ore mask" does and whether the quarry is poison-y or just dusty.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Advanced room by room, used pits as a choke, and never overpulled.
   - Rogue scouted for a sewer shortcut but did not find one (fine).
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Heavy hits in open pits taught defensive play. The cleric had to triage, not just top off.
   - Worm ambush: the first tell was not obvious enough; they ate the hit once, then learned.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Illegal dig: net-throwers created panic. Wizard solved it with area denial and the fighter peeled.
   - Choice room: party argued but wanted a quick summary of tradeoffs before locking it in.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - No secret found. They expected one "side tunnel" that skips a pit room at the cost of a harder pull.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Breaker-7: the slow slam was learnable; the shove was surprising because it felt like a hidden check.
   - They beat it, got the stamped pass, and felt like they earned travel permission.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: held the open pit pull and peeled net-throwers off the backline.
- cleric: kept the party alive through heavy hits and taught "triage under pressure".
- rogue: scouted ahead and made the worm tell readable by paying attention to room details.
- wizard: stabilized the illegal dig by controlling flanks and preventing a net cascade.
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Worm ambush needs a stronger telegraph before the first hit. After that, it can be subtle.
- Net-throwers need clear counterplay messaging (break net, focus thrower, or similar).
- Choice room needs a short, readable "what changes" summary and an explicit confirmation step.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add an explicit one-line worm tell before the first ambush hit.
- TODO: Add clear net counterplay text and ensure it is teachable, not surprise-only.
- TODO: Add confirm/vote affordance for union vs foreman choice.
