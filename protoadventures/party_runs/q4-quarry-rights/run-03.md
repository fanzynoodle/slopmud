# Party Run: q4-quarry-rights / run-03

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 6/6/6/6/7
- classes: paladin, bard, ranger, druid, sorcerer
- tags: over-leveled, roleplay-heavy, nonlethal-intent

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Treated the foreman and union rep as the main content. Wanted both to have reasonable points.
   - Asked for a third option: "take proof to a neutral clerk" instead of choosing a side.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Ranger led route through pits with minimal fighting, using "watch telegraphs" as the team's mantra.
   - They wanted one optional side room with lore about why the quarry exists.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Worm ambush was too easy at this level band; they wanted a variant where ignoring tells has a non-damage consequence (separation, dropped item).
   - Illegal dig: net-throwers were the only real threat. They wanted the encounter to respond to focus play (if you kill throwers first, it gets easier fast).
4. setpiece / spike
   - Choice room: they wanted moral framing and an explicit summary of what changes (reward flavor, who calls you later).
   - Breaker-7 died quickly; the interrupt lesson never landed. They wanted an optional "hard mode" knob for a better reward.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - No secret found. Proposed a "barricade shortcut" that the barbarian could open, or a druid flavor "stabilize burrow" side loop.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Checkpoint pass was satisfying, but they wanted the gatehouse NPC to react to their choice.
   - They chose union because it matched their stewardship framing.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: carried the moral weight of the choice and insisted it should be logged clearly.
- bard: defused the argument in the choice room and extracted more context from NPCs.
- ranger: route-led and made pits feel navigable rather than random.
- druid: pushed a nonlethal framing and asked for a "stabilize burrow" optional side task.
- sorcerer: burst down net-throwers to keep the illegal dig from becoming chaos.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- wizard: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Over-leveled parties need an optional difficulty knob (Breaker-7 hard mode or dig escalation) with modest reward.
- The choice should have a summary, confirmation, and downstream acknowledgement (gatehouse reacts).
- Add one optional lore/side room or task so the zone has a secret beyond pure combat.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a one-room optional side task (stabilize burrow or barricade shortcut) that rewards curiosity.
- TODO: Add optional "hard mode" toggle for Breaker-7 with modest reward.
- TODO: Ensure gatehouse NPC acknowledges the chosen side.
