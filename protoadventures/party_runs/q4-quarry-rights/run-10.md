# Party Run: q4-quarry-rights / run-10

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 4/4/5/6
- classes: barbarian, fighter, rogue, cleric
- tags: overpull, chaos, lesson-test

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Accepted and immediately tried to sprint forward. The restock node forced them to see consumables first, which helped.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Overpulled pits twice. Retreat to the shack worked as a recovery loop and did not feel like a punitive reset.
   - Rogue started calling regroup points, which stabilized the run.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Worm ambush taught the lesson because the first telegraph was explicit.
   - Illegal dig: nets caused the only near wipe. Once they learned counterplay, the setpiece became manageable.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Choice room: confirm/vote prevented trolling and made the decision deliberate.
   - Breaker-7: shove displaced the cleric once, but the arena edge hint made it legible and recoverable.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Missed secrets. They did not care, but a secret would help players who do.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Gatehouse acknowledgement made the story coherent even for a chaos party.
   - Sealed north teaser exit made them feel like the world is bigger than the quest.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: saved overpull mistakes by deleting priority threats quickly.
- fighter: held pits chokes and peeled nets off the cleric during the dig.
- rogue: stabilized chaos via regroup calls and paying attention to tells.
- cleric: kept the party alive through heavy hits and net panics.
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Illegal dig needs readable wave boundaries so parties can time resources and avoid panic.
- The restock node should explicitly hint that retreating is valid and that progress persists.
- Choice confirmation should exist to prevent griefing.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add readable wave boundary feedback in the illegal dig setpiece.
- TODO: Add one short "retreat is valid" hint at the restock node.
- TODO: Keep choice confirm/vote step and log/echo the decision.
