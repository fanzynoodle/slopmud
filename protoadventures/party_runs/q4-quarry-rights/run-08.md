# Party Run: q4-quarry-rights / run-08

## Party

- size: 3 (2 humans + 1 assist bot)
- levels: 4/5/6
- classes: monk, wizard, bot:vanguard
- tags: bot-fill, two-humans, speedrun, movement-skill

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Accepted quickly, stocked up at the shack, and asked for the shortest path to the checkpoint pass.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Rushed pits and relied on mobility to avoid overpull disasters.
   - Skipped optional content (no secrets, no extended dialogue).
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Worm ambush: they avoided it cleanly because the first telegraph was strong.
   - Illegal dig: wizard controlled flanks; monk freed from nets quickly; bot held predictable aggro.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Choice room: they wanted it to be quick and explicit. Confirm step prevented accidental selection.
   - Breaker-7: shove was the only danger. The arena edge hint plus brace/disrupt made it fair.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Skipped.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Checkpoint teaser exit north being sealed still felt good because it implied the road exists.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- monk: carried movement counterplay (nets and shove) and made hazards feel solvable.
- wizard: solved the illegal dig with control and made the run stable even at speed.
- bot:vanguard: held aggro predictably and did not solve mechanics.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Assist bot behavior must remain simple and non-invasive. It should not interact with choice prompts or solve counterplay.
- Choice prompt text should be short enough to not break a speedrun cadence.
- Illegal dig needs clear wave boundaries so speed parties can time cooldowns.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Keep assist bot behavior "frontline only" by default.
- TODO: Keep choice prompt summary short and confirm explicit.
- TODO: Add readable wave boundary feedback in the illegal dig setpiece.
