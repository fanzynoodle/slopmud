# Party Run: q4-quarry-rights / run-06

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 4/4/4/5/6
- classes: barbarian, fighter, rogue, cleric, monk
- tags: overpull, chaos, lesson-test

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Accepted and immediately tried to sprint to Breaker-7 without caring about the illegal dig context.
   - The linear flow prevented sequence breaking; they still caused problems by overpulling.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Overpulled pits twice, then learned to treat them as "telegraph rooms" not "trash".
   - Rogue started marking regroup points, which reduced wipes.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Worm ambush punished greed hard. Once the first explicit telegraph fired, the lesson landed.
   - Illegal dig: nets created the biggest chaos. Once the party learned counterplay, the fight stabilized.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Choice room: the party wanted to rush, but the confirm step prevented accidental selection.
   - Breaker-7: they nearly wiped once when shove displaced the cleric. They requested one backup counterplay (stagger, interrupt, or brace) so it is not purely positional.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Missed any secret. They did not care, but a secret would help players who do.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Gatehouse acknowledgement made the story feel coherent even for a chaos party.
   - Checkpoint access felt like a reset point after a messy run.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: saved overpull mistakes by deleting priority threats and restoring tempo.
- fighter: held pits chokes and peeled for the cleric under net pressure.
- rogue: turned chaos into a plan by marking regroup points and reading worm tells.
- cleric: kept the run alive through heavy hits and net panics.
- monk: handled movement-heavy moments and stabilized the party during shove displacement.
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- The dig setpiece needs to teach nets fast. One explicit "how to break nets" line is enough.
- Breaker-7 shove should have both positional and disruption counterplay so parties have options.
- Overpull parties need a clear retreat story that does not feel like punitive reset.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Ensure the illegal dig teaches net counterplay once, clearly.
- TODO: Add a second shove counterplay option (brace/disrupt) to reduce "hidden check" feeling.
- TODO: Make retreat/recovery loop clear via the shack restock node messaging.
