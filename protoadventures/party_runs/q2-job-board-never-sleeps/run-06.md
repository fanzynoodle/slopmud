# Party Run: q2-job-board-never-sleeps / run-06

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 1/2/2
- classes: fighter, rogue, wizard
- tags: no-healer, brand-new, cautious

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Accepted three contracts and asked where to stock up because they had no healer.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Market Row became mandatory. They bought extra bandages and felt smart for doing so.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Orchard drones were dangerous without sustain. Rogue learned LOS play, fighter peeled, wizard controlled.
   - Meadow pests were used to "refill confidence" after orchard.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Delivery contract was the spike because it asked for navigation precision and a noncombat success condition.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Wanted a backlane shortcut that reduces travel time between hub and orchard without making orchard trivial.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Picked industrial because they wanted heavier fights and a clear "next zone" pointer.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: protected squishies in orchard and prevented panic retreats.
- rogue: learned LOS tactics and turned ranged pressure into manageable pulls.
- wizard: controlled orchard pulls and prevented a no-healer comp from wiping.
- cleric: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- No-healer parties need Market Row to be clearly positioned as required prep, not optional flavor.
- Orchard needs very explicit LOS/cover messaging because it is the first ranged-pressure loop.
- Delivery needs a clear completion line to avoid uncertainty.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit hub messaging that points no-healer parties to Market Row.
- TODO: Add clearer LOS/cover teaching in orchard rooms.
- TODO: Add explicit delivery completion feedback at the receiver.
