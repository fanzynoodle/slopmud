# Party Run: q2-job-board-never-sleeps / run-05

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 1
- classes: bard
- tags: social-build, roleplay-heavy, town-only-first

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Wanted to solve problems socially. Gravitate toward the delivery contract and job board dialogue.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Did town-only contract first, then market, then meadow (avoided orchard until last).
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Meadow pests were fine, but they wanted a "talk down" option for flavor even if combat still happens.
   - Orchard drones felt harsh for solo; wanted very readable line-of-sight options.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Choice contact was their favorite beat, but they wanted each contact to have a voice (one line, distinct attitude).
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Wanted a secret backlane that rewards curiosity and adds a shortcut to the orchard trail.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Picked civic because it sounded like "people problems".
   - Wanted the board to unlock a repeatable that is social, not combat (future).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- bard: validated town-only contract value; tested whether faction contacts have distinct voice; pushed for social repeatables.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Solo run balance for orchard needs clear cover/LOS teaching and forgiving pulls.
- Faction contact choice needs distinct voice and immediate meaning.
- Secret/shortcut content should be hinted, not invisible.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add clearer solo-friendly orchard pathing and cover hints.
- TODO: Give each faction contact one distinct line so the choice feels real.
- TODO: Add a hinted backlane shortcut hook (points to side alley fence).
