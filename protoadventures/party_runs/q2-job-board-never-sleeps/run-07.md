# Party Run: q2-job-board-never-sleeps / run-07

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 4/4/4
- classes: paladin, ranger, cleric
- tags: over-leveled, fast-clear, boredom-test

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Treated Q2 as a checklist to unlock repeatables as fast as possible.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Skipped prep entirely and brute-forced everything. It worked, but they were bored.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Pest sweep and drone tag were trivial; only travel time mattered.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Delivery contract was the most fun because it was different.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Ignored secrets. They only care if a secret saves time or unlocks something.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Picked green to unlock exploration content next.
   - Wanted a small optional difficulty knob or speedrun timer to make repeat play interesting.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: made the faction choice feel like a deliberate commitment despite low difficulty.
- ranger: route-optimized and made signage feel like gameplay.
- cleric: turned the run into a smooth sprint by enabling safe mistakes.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- wizard: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Over-leveled runs need optional spice (opt-in harder pulls, timer, or variant contract) so they aren't pure travel.
- Repeatables unlock should include one explicit "this matters" teaser so it feels worth doing.
- Completion feedback should be immediate and consistent to support speedruns.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add an optional "speedrun" variant or timer (future) once repeatables exist.
- TODO: Add a small teaser line when repeatables unlock (daily caps later, etc).
- TODO: Ensure consistent completion feedback formatting for all three contracts.
