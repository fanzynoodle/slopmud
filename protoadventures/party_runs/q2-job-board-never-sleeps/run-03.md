# Party Run: q2-job-board-never-sleeps / run-03

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 2/2/2
- classes: barbarian, fighter, monk
- tags: all-melee, trio, tempo-play

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took contracts in the order that minimized travel (orchard, meadow, backlane).
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Tried to sprint between rooms and got punished by chain pulls in meadow.
   - Wanted movement cost to be low in the newbie region (it should be).
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Orchard drones were annoying for all-melee; they needed cover and corner play to close distance.
   - Meadow pests were fine; lesson was pacing and not overpulling.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Delivery contract was the spike because there was no obvious success confirmation until the receiver.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They wanted a melee-only shortcut (break a barricade) to feel special.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Picked industrial because it sounded like quarry content and heavier fights.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: solved the orchard by forcing tempo and deleting priority drones once in range.
- fighter: kept the trio from chain-pulling in meadow by anchoring chokes.
- monk: made movement-based fights feel clean; solved "close distance" problems.
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- All-melee needs a clear "how to handle ranged pressure" lesson in orchard (cover, corners, line-of-sight).
- Delivery contract needs explicit success confirmation at handoff.
- Contracts should have consistent travel lengths and signage so route optimization is satisfying.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit cover/LOS teaching in the orchard loop for melee parties.
- TODO: Add explicit success confirmation for delivery contract completion.
- TODO: Add signage hints so route optimization feels intentional, not guessy.
