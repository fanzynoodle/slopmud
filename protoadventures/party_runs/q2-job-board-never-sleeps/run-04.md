# Party Run: q2-job-board-never-sleeps / run-04

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 3/3/3
- classes: wizard, sorcerer, warlock
- tags: all-caster, fast-clear, overconfident

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Treated contracts as a checklist and wanted to speedrun them.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Skipped Market Row and regretted it when they ran low on sustain in orchard.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Orchard drones were trivial for them, but they overpulled and got punished by ranged focus.
   - Meadow pests were a joke but taught "overpull still wastes time".
4. setpiece / spike
   - Delivery contract was surprisingly fun because it broke combat monotony.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Ignored secrets. They only care if a secret saves time.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Picked green because it sounded like new zones and puzzles.
   - Wanted the board clerk to call out "go to maintenance for sewers" or "go to quarry" as a next pointer.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: controlled orchard pulls and prevented a fast-clear from becoming a wipe.
- sorcerer: burst down priority targets to keep tempo high.
- warlock: accepted risk to finish fights faster and tested the limits of overpull safety.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a clear reminder that Market Row is the sustain loop, even for confident parties.
- Need the board to clearly point at Q3/Q4 hooks after faction choice, not just unlock flags.
- Need consistent completion feedback for each contract so speedrunners don't doubt success.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a short "prep matters" reminder at the job board hub.
- TODO: Add explicit next-step pointers after faction choice (maintenance office, quarry, rustwood).
- TODO: Add consistent contract completion feedback text.
