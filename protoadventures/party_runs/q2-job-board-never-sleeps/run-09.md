# Party Run: q2-job-board-never-sleeps / run-09

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 2/3/3
- classes: ranger, druid, cleric
- tags: lore-hounds, nonlethal-intent, slow-play

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Read every line at the board and wanted to understand why each contract exists.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Took their time and wanted more environmental cues to feel like they're leaving town.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Wanted a nonlethal framing for meadow pests and orchard drones (text-only is fine).
4. setpiece / spike
   - Delivery contract was their favorite because it involved NPCs. They wanted a tiny dialogue payoff at turn-in.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Wanted the courier to explicitly point at "alley fence" side content as a rumor.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Picked green and wanted a clear "you unlocked rustwood/library routes" teaser.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger: navigated and made signage feel like a skill, not a UI.
- druid: pushed nonlethal framing and environmental storytelling for basic mobs.
- cleric: kept the slow play safe and made debuff cleanup feel meaningful.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- wizard: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need light nonlethal framing text so roleplay parties don't feel like they're roleplaying against the game.
- Need a tiny dialogue payoff at turn-in so the board isn't purely transactional.
- Need clear next-step teasers after faction choice so the unlock flags feel real.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add minimal nonlethal framing for pests/drones (text only).
- TODO: Add one short turn-in line per contract that acknowledges completion.
- TODO: Add explicit next-step teasers after choosing a contact.
