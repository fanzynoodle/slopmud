# Party Run: q2-job-board-never-sleeps / run-02

## Party

- size: 2
- levels: 1/2
- classes: rogue, cleric
- tags: duo, cautious, objective-first

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Treated the board like a quest hub and wanted to accept all three contracts at once.
   - Asked if they could fail a contract and retry.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Rogue scouted the backlane route first (town-only, low risk) to build confidence.
   - Then did orchard, then meadow, to end on the safest combat loop.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Orchard drones forced the rogue to play cover and the cleric to triage debuff pressure.
   - Meadow pests were easy but taught "don't get sloppy" because they chain aggro.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Faction contact choice felt like a meaningful roleplay moment, but they wanted a 2-line summary of what each contact unlocks immediately.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found no shortcut. They wanted the courier to hint at a hidden backlane fence (points to side content).
6. resolution / rewards
   - Picked green because it sounded like exploration and navigation.
   - Wanted a clear statement that choice is not permanent-lock for early builds (even if it is later).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- rogue: route-led and made the delivery contract feel like skill, not walking.
- cleric: kept the duo stable in orchard; taught debuff cleanup and pacing.
- fighter: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Accepting multiple contracts at once should be supported or explicitly denied with a clear reason.
- Faction choice needs immediate meaning in one sentence per option.
- Courier hinting should connect Q2 to side content without requiring spoilers.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Decide if multiple contracts can be accepted simultaneously and implement clear messaging either way.
- TODO: Add explicit one-sentence "immediate unlock" hints for civic/industrial/green.
- TODO: Add a courier hint line that points to a side quest hook (alley fence).
