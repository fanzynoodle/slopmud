# Party Run: q2-job-board-never-sleeps / run-10

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 2
- classes: monk
- tags: solo, movement-focused, speedrun

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Treated Q2 as a routing problem. Wanted all travel edges to be short in the newbie region.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Ran meadow first, then delivery, then orchard, to keep risk late.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Orchard drones punished solo mistakes; monk mobility made it manageable via cover and quick retreats.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Delivery contract was the spike because it tested navigation without combat safety nets.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Looked for a backlane shortcut and did not find one.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Picked industrial because it sounded like "movement matters in quarry" and wanted to go there next.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- monk: validated travel length expectations in newbie region; solved ranged pressure solo via mobility; made delivery navigation feel like skill.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Solo orchard needs very readable cover/LOS guidance and forgiving retreat loop.
- Newbie region travel lengths should be kept short so routing feels fun, not punishing.
- Backlane shortcut should exist or be explicitly hinted as side content.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Improve solo orchard readability (cover hints, retreat loop).
- TODO: Keep newbie travel edges short and signposted.
- TODO: Add a hinted backlane shortcut hook to side content.
