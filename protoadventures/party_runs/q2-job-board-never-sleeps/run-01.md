# Party Run: q2-job-board-never-sleeps / run-01

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 1
- classes: fighter
- tags: brand-new, solo, human, reads-prompts

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Walked into the square and asked "what do I do now" until the board text made it obvious.
   - Took the first contract offered (pest sweep) because it sounded simplest.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Went Market Row first when told to prep; bought bandages even though they did not know if needed.
   - Followed the Meadowline signpost and returned to town immediately after success.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Pest sweep was fine but they almost overpulled because pests felt harmless.
   - Drone tag was scarier due to ranged pressure; they learned to break line-of-sight by backing around roots.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Backlane delivery was the spike for them because it was "no combat" and they worried about failing silently.
   - The "door that is actually just push" taught persistence and re-trying verbs.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Did not find any shortcut. They would have taken a backlane shortcut if hinted.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Completed 3 contracts, chose civic because it sounded like "stability", and unlocked repeatables.
   - They wanted an explicit "repeatables unlocked" confirmation line and where to see them.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: learned safe pull sizing in pests; held steady under ranged pressure in orchard; handled delivery navigation without combat.
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- The board needs a very explicit "choose a contract A/B/C" presentation (text-only clarity).
- Turn-ins need a consistent acknowledgement and a visible counter (`contracts_done=2/3`).
- Repeatables unlock needs a clear UI/UX hook: "type: jobs" or similar.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit contract selection text and short reminders at the hub.
- TODO: Add consistent turn-in acknowledgement and contract counter feedback.
- TODO: Add a clear post-completion prompt that teaches how to access repeatables.
