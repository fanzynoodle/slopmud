# Party Run: q1-first-day-on-gaia / run-01

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 1
- classes: fighter
- tags: brand-new, human, cautious

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Read the first room and tried to talk to the first NPC before moving.
   - Asked "am I allowed to be here" and wanted reassurance that this is safe.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Moved slowly and re-`look`ed after every drill room to confirm they did it right.
   - Got briefly turned around on the dorm drill because the doors were identical (good lesson).
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Prep bay: hoarded the heal item because they did not know if they'd need it later.
   - Training drone: fought cautiously, asked "how do I know if I'm winning".
4. setpiece / spike
   - Hazard strip was the first "oh, movement matters" moment. They failed once, then succeeded.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Did not find the dorm supply closet; they never tried `search`.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Took the town pass, then hesitated at the kit kiosk because they were afraid of choosing wrong.
   - Picked human kit; liked that it was framed as flavor.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: learned the verb loop (`get`/`drop`/`equip`); held steady in the drone scenario; solved hazard strip by moving on purpose.
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Needs a clearer "you are safe here" line early (new player anxiety).
- Combat needs simple feedback words ("hit", "miss", "enemy is reeling") so players know what's happening.
- Kit choice needs "you can change later" messaging (even if it's a lie for now) to reduce fear.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add one explicit reassurance line in `R_NS_ORIENT_01`.
- TODO: Add clearer hit/health feedback for the training drone scenario.
- TODO: Add a one-line "choices are flavor (for now)" note at the kiosk.
