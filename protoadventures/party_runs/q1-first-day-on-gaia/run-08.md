# Party Run: q1-first-day-on-gaia / run-08

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 1
- classes: paladin
- tags: rules-first, reads-conduct, wants-clarity

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Wanted to see the rules up front and asked "what is allowed here".
   - Treated the badge and pass as moral objects, not just keys.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Followed drills as written and wanted confirmations after each step.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Combat rooms were fine, but they asked for one line that frames violence as "simulation lessons".
4. setpiece / spike
   - Hazard strip taught movement and felt fair.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Did not search for secrets; they prioritize official paths.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Wanted the town pass acceptance to explicitly echo the code of conduct framing.
   - Picked human kit because it felt more responsibility-coded.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: validated rules-first UX; treated badge/pass as an ethos moment; wanted confirmations and explicit framing.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Needs an explicit "rules" pointer early for rules-first players.
- Needs explicit confirmations after drill steps.
- Needs town pass acceptance to feel like a deliberate commitment, not a vending machine click.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a `rules` prompt early in orientation (or a sign that says "type: rules").
- TODO: Add "drill complete" acknowledgements for the verbs drills.
- TODO: Add one town-pass acceptance line that echoes the conduct framing.
