# Party Run: q1-first-day-on-gaia / run-04

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 1
- classes: bard
- tags: social-build, roleplay-heavy, reads-dialogue

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Treated Kline and R0 as characters and tried to "make a good impression".
   - Wanted more than one response line from each NPC (even if it's canned).
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Spent time in the dorm hall talking to other new arrivals.
   - Tried to `who` to see who else is online, even though it's a tutorial.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Combat labs were tolerated, but they mainly wanted the world to respond socially.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Hazard strip was fine; they wanted the med bay to explicitly frame failure as normal.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They tried to find the supply closet but didn't know the verb. They would have found it if hinted.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Picked human kit because it sounded like "more people".
   - Wanted the town gate plaza to have at least one greeter NPC line to cap the tutorial.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- bard: made the dorm room feel alive; validated `who`/social UX in tutorial; tested failure messaging and wanted it framed gently.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Needs minimal "NPC loop" lines so roleplay players feel seen (even simple randomized one-liners).
- Needs `who` to work or be stubbed with a friendly "not yet" response in tutorial.
- Needs a tutorial hint for `search` if we expect anyone to find the supply closet.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add 3-5 canned NPC responses for Kline and R0 that trigger on simple prompts.
- TODO: Ensure `who` is safe in tutorial (works or gives a friendly stub).
- TODO: Add a `search` hint in dorms so the optional closet is discoverable.
