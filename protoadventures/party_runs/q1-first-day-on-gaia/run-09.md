# Party Run: q1-first-day-on-gaia / run-09

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 1
- classes: druid
- tags: environmental, nonlethal-intent, roleplay-heavy

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Asked if the facility is "alive" and wanted environmental detail.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Re-read room descriptions to infer what each drill is teaching.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Training drone: asked if there is a "disable" option or if combat is mandatory in a tutorial.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Hazard strip: wanted hazard feedback to be described as environmental pressure, not just damage.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Tried to look for the supply closet by "noticing air currents", but didn't know `search`.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Picked robot kit because it felt like coexistence framing.
   - Wanted the town gate plaza to have one visible "humans + robots" moment (NPC line or signage).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- druid: pushed environmental description; tested nonlethal framing; validated that hazard feedback language matters.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Needs a consistent nonlethal framing line for tutorial combat (even if mechanics are the same).
- Needs hazard messaging to be described as environmental, not random.
- Needs `search` taught if secret content is intended.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a line in labs that frames combat as simulation with nonlethal intent.
- TODO: Improve hazard strip descriptions so they read as environmental pressure.
- TODO: Add a `search` hint so the dorm closet can be found by observant players.
