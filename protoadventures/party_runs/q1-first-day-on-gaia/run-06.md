# Party Run: q1-first-day-on-gaia / run-06

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 1
- classes: cleric
- tags: brand-new, anxious, wants-safety-rails

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Asked whether dying is permanent and whether they can lose items.
   - Wanted the tutorial to explicitly promise that this is a safe place to learn.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Followed the drills exactly and waited for confirmation text after each.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Training drone: they used the heal item early and asked if they wasted it.
   - Two pests: target switching was the first "this is real" moment.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Hazard strip: they failed once and wanted the med bay to explicitly say "failure is expected".
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Did not search for secrets; did not want to risk "doing it wrong".
6. resolution / rewards
   - Town gate plaza felt like relief. They wanted a clear pointer: "job board is next".

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- cleric: validated the recovery loop messaging; tested consumable usage timing; wanted gentle failure framing.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Needs explicit tutorial promises around death/recovery so anxious players continue.
- Needs explicit confirmations after drills so players know they succeeded.
- Needs a clear "what now" pointer at the town gate.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a 2-sentence death/recovery promise in `R_NS_LABS_01` or `R_NS_LABS_06`.
- TODO: Add explicit drill completion acknowledgements for verbs drills.
- TODO: Add a clear "go to job board" pointer in `R_TOWN_GATE_01`.
