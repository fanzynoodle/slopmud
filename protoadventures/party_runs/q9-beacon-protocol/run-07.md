# Party Run: q9-beacon-protocol / run-07

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 10
- classes: bard, paladin, druid, fighter, rogue
- tags: social-builds, rescue-first, roleplay-heavy

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they refuse to treat the Underrail as "just monsters." They look for stranded travelers and nonlethal routes.
2. Platform: bard negotiates for an official "evac token" that lets them open one sealed service door (future rep hook).
3. Beacon 1: they rescue a trapped worker before starting the charge (time cost, feels heroic).
4. Switchyard: druid tries to calm "pack crawlers" instead of killing them; sometimes works, sometimes fails.
5. Beacon 2 and 3: they take the slow safe route and avoid patrol stacking.
6. Boss: they attempt to "parley" with the warden. It fails, but changes the add pattern into a more readable rhythm (would be a great feature).
7. Resolution: they want explicit support for rescue-first and nonlethal play (rep, shortcuts, services).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- bard: negotiations, coordination, and making it feel like infrastructure and people.
- paladin: moral anchor; rescue framing.
- druid: signature druid beat: nonlethal interactions with tunnel life.
- fighter: protection and objective anchoring.
- rogue: route scouting and service door access.
- cleric/wizard/ranger/barbarian/warlock/sorcerer/monk: absent.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Nonlethal choices need clear rewards and signaling.
- "Parley changes fight" needs consistent trigger rules.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an optional traveler-rescue sub-objective tied to beacon charges.
- TODO: define a boss parley trigger: fails but changes fight rhythm.
