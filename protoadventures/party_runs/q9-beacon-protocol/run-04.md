# Party Run: q9-beacon-protocol / run-04

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 10
- classes: wizard, cleric, warlock, sorcerer, bard
- tags: all-casters, lore-hounds, cautious

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they treat it like infrastructure restoration, not a dungeon crawl.
2. Beacon charges: easy. Wizard control + sorcerer burst trivialize defense waves.
3. Warlock takes an optional "bind beacon" bargain at beacon 3: charge faster, but leaves a lingering "signal debt" token.
4. Switchyard: bard calls cadence and patrol timing; it feels like a rhythm game.
5. Boss: they win first try. Only scary moment is a phase shift that spawns adds behind them.
6. Resolution: they want bargains to be explicit and persistent (token, cost, payoff).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: makes beacon defenses clean and safe.
- cleric: keeps long traversal from turning into attrition death.
- bard: coordination and timing; makes the switchyard feel intentional.
- warlock: optional bargain adds texture and pacing variance.
- sorcerer: burst makes add windows trivial.
- fighter/rogue/ranger/paladin/druid/barbarian/monk: absent; see TODOs.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Bargain UX needs standardization: opt-in, explicit cost, capped risk.
- Boss add spawns behind the party need a loud warning line.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define "beacon bind" bargain pattern (debt tokens, paydown, cap).
- TODO: add 1-2 lore objects that explain what beacons do (reward curiosity).
