# Party Run: q9-beacon-protocol / run-10

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 10
- classes: warlock, barbarian, cleric, wizard, bard
- tags: bargain-heavy, chaotic, wipe-once

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: warlock wants to test "bind beacon" bargains; barbarian wants to pull big; bard wants a story.
2. Beacon 1: they take a bargain and charge faster, but it spawns extra hazard pulses. They ignore it and nearly wipe.
3. Switchyard: barbarian overpulls into a patrol lane and they wipe once. The run becomes a lesson in discipline.
4. Regroup: bard sets rules, cleric stabilizes, wizard controls. They stop taking bargains for a while.
5. Beacons 2-4: they do clean charges. Warlock takes one more bargain with explicit agreement: "last one."
6. Boss: they win by saving burst and control for add windows and treating add caller as the fight.
7. Resolution: bargains are fun if costs are explicit, capped, and persistent (debt tokens).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- warlock: bargain system’s poster child; introduces optional risk texture.
- barbarian: chaos agent and then add clearer during boss.
- cleric: stabilizes the run after wipe; keeps attrition from killing them.
- wizard: converts chaos into solvable phases.
- bard: comms and cadence are the win condition.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Bargain UX must be loud: debt token count, next consequence, paydown options.
- Wipe recovery needs a less punishing path back (safe pocket).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: codify bind beacon rules: max debt, escalating costs, how to pay down.
- TODO: add a platform checkpoint after beacon 2.
