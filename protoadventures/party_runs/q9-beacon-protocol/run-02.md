# Party Run: q9-beacon-protocol / run-02

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: all 9 (under-leveled)
- classes: barbarian, monk, sorcerer
- tags: under-leveled, no-healer, speedrun

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they want Skybridge access fast. Plan: touch beacons ASAP, skip fights.
2. Beacon 1: they rush it and trigger a defense wave while a patrol is nearby. They survive, but resources are thin.
3. Tunnels: monk becomes the run leader; keeps them from stopping in ambush bends.
4. Beacon 2: they fail the first charge because they start it while adds are still alive. Sorcerer bursts but can’t cover mistakes forever.
5. Switchyard: they try to sprint through; get pinned by ranged sentries with no cover. Retreat happens.
6. They learn to clear "safe squares" first, then commit to the charge.
7. Beacon 3: barbarian has a hero moment forcing a stuck hatch open to create a shortcut escape route.
8. Beacon 4: they complete it barely, but refuse boss attempt. No-healer + under-level makes the boss feel like a wipe-farm.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: brute-force shortcut moment; also absorbs punishment when plans fail.
- monk: traversal mastery; without it, party wipes to tunnels alone.
- sorcerer: burst windows save them from add snowballs repeatedly.
- cleric: absent; absence defines the run.
- wizard: absent; beacon defenses are harder without control.
- ranger: absent; ranged sentries are a problem without ranged picks.
- rogue: absent; scouting/secret discovery is weaker and navigation suffers.
- paladin/bard/druid/warlock/fighter: absent; see TODOs.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need clear gate messaging: "Boss requires 4/4 beacons."
- Need a safe pocket so speed parties can reset without full re-clear.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a mid-run safe room at the platform after beacon 2 (checkpoint vibe).
- TODO: add an alternate slower route for under-leveled/no-healer parties.
