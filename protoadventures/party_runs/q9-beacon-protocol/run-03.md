# Party Run: q9-beacon-protocol / run-03

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 10
- classes: fighter, paladin, barbarian, monk, rogue
- tags: all-melee, stubborn, hazard-respect

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: paladin frames it as "protecting the line so travelers don’t die in tunnels."
2. Beacon 1 and 2: fine; melee holds points well. The pain is ranged sentries on platforms.
3. They adapt: pull sentries into corners and fight where LOS is broken.
4. Switchyard: patrol timing becomes the run. Monk scouts; rogue watches signals; fighter calls "cross now".
5. Secret: rogue finds a maintenance lever that temporarily disables one turret-sentry lane (melee-friendly).
6. Beacon 3 and 4: they do clean charges, rotating who touches beacon while others hold.
7. Boss: first attempt wipe when adds spawn far and they can’t reach quickly. Second attempt they manipulate add spawns by standing in specific zones (cool if real).
8. Resolution: melee is viable if there are consistent cover and lure tools.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: timing captain; holds the platform center.
- paladin: defensive anchor; keeps wipes from cascading.
- barbarian: brute force and panic button when patrols stack.
- monk: traversal captain and scouting; makes timing puzzles fun.
- rogue: signal-reading and secret lever discovery.
- cleric/wizard/ranger/bard/druid/warlock/sorcerer: absent; see TODOs.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Melee needs a consistent answer to far adds (lure, levers, cover pulls).
- Patrol timing needs very readable signals or it feels arbitrary.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a lure tool in switchyard rooms (noise maker, flare, bait) to pull far adds.
- TODO: codify "signal language" so timing is learnable.
