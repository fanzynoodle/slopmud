# Party Run: q9-beacon-protocol / run-05

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: all 13 (over-leveled)
- classes: fighter, cleric, ranger, wizard
- tags: over-leveled, bored-test, efficient

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they take it for unlock chain. Expect to faceroll.
2. Beacons: trivial. Patrols still matter because timing punishes sloppy movement.
3. Boss: HP isn’t a challenge, but phase add mechanics still punish ignoring the fight rules.
4. Resolution: they want an optional hard mode (extra beacon, optional elite patrol) for better rewards.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger: still shines picking off fast threats; prevents chain pulls.
- wizard: turns timing mistakes into recoverable moments with control.
- fighter/cleric: mostly safety net.
- others: absent; needs optional difficulty knobs for experienced parties.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Not enough optional bite for over-leveled parties.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: optional "fifth beacon" hard mode behind a risk lever.
- TODO: boss shield phase tied to adds so DPS can’t skip mechanics.
