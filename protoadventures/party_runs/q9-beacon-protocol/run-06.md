# Party Run: q9-beacon-protocol / run-06

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: all 9 (under-leveled)
- classes: paladin, rogue, cleric
- tags: under-leveled, cautious, no-caster

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: paladin frames it as "safe routes for everyone"; cleric agrees; rogue wants the secret doors.
2. Beacon 1: success after a slow clear. They learn the beacon charge UX.
3. Switchyard: ranged sentries hurt. They lure fights into corners and move only when signals indicate patrol gaps.
4. Beacon 2: first charge fails due to patrol arriving mid-charge. Second attempt works after clearing patrol first.
5. Secret: rogue finds a maintenance door that bypasses one patrol lane (feels required for this comp).
6. Beacon 3 and 4: slow but stable. Cleric resource management defines pacing.
7. Boss: two attempts. They win by assigning roles: paladin anchors, rogue kills add caller, cleric sustains.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: defensive escort; makes timing mistakes survivable.
- rogue: secret discovery and add-caller assassin role.
- cleric: sustain and cleanse; without it, run fails.
- wizard/ranger/sorcerer: absent; far adds are harder without ranged tools.
- fighter/monk/bard/druid/barbarian/warlock: absent.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Wipe recovery is demoralizing without a safe pocket.
- Need consistent lure tools for melee-only add reach.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a platform safe room unlock after beacon 2 (checkpoint).
- TODO: add explicit lure mechanics (noise maker, lever, flare).
