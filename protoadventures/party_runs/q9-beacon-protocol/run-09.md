# Party Run: q9-beacon-protocol / run-09

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 10
- classes: ranger, ranger, rogue, monk, sorcerer
- tags: ranged-heavy, kite-first, fast-clear

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they speedrun the beacons for Skybridge access.
2. Beacons: ranger duo deletes threats before pressure stacks. Monk keeps them moving and prevents patrol overlaps.
3. Switchyard: they treat it like a timing puzzle and cross only on signal windows.
4. Secret: monk finds a maintenance crawl that skips a patrol lane; they feel rewarded for moving correctly.
5. Boss: sorcerer burst trivializes add windows; they win first try.
6. Resolution: they want a clean-clear reward hook (cosmetic/token/rep).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- rangers: signature Underrail run: threat removal at range.
- rogue: pull discipline and route scouting.
- monk: timing + traversal captain; keeps speedrun clean.
- sorcerer: burst makes boss add windows safe.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a consistent "don’t drag patrols into beacon rooms" penalty or alert system.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define Underrail alert level escalation if you chain-pull into beacon charges.
- TODO: add a speedrun/perfect-clear reward.
