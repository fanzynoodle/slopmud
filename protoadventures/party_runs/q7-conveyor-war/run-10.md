# Party Run: q7-conveyor-war / run-10

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 8
- classes: warlock, barbarian, cleric, wizard, bard
- tags: bargain-heavy, chaotic, wipe-once

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they accept because the warlock hears about "overclock consoles" and wants to push them.
2. Entry: wizard controls corridors; barbarian gets bored and pulls extra packs. Alert spirals.
3. Shutdown 1: warlock overclocks the console. Wave is shorter, but it spawns an extra hazard (sparks) that punishes standing still.
4. Shutdown 2: they overclock again. Now they have two debt tokens and the hazards stack. They wipe once because they ignore the cost.
5. Regroup: bard gets the run back on rails by establishing callouts and limiting bargains to one more.
6. Shutdown 3: they do it cleanly without overclock; it feels noticeably slower but safer.
7. Boss: they win by treating the add call as the real boss. Cleric and bard keep people alive; wizard and barbarian delete adds; warlock saves a big cooldown for the add call.
8. Resolution: the bargain system is fun, but only if the costs are explicit and readable.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: no fighter in party; would reduce chaos from overpulling.
- rogue: no rogue in party; would find quiet routes and reduce exposure.
- cleric: saves the run after wipe; stabilizes the hazard stacking.
- wizard: keeps corridors solvable even when party is chaotic.
- ranger: no ranger in party; would shine in preventing belt-runner chaos.
- paladin: no paladin in party; would have argued against reckless bargains.
- bard: turns the run from chaos into coordination after a wipe.
- druid: no druid in party; would shine in hazard mitigation.
- barbarian: causes the chaos, then redeems it by deleting add waves in boss.
- warlock: the bargain system’s poster child; pushes risk into explicit costs.
- sorcerer: no sorcerer in party; would shine deleting waves even faster.
- monk: no monk in party; traversal mistakes are more common.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Bargain costs need clear UI: "Debt token 2/3", "hazard: sparks", "next overclock will spawn elite".
- Need a safe "reset room" after a wipe so re-clearing isn't demoralizing.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: codify overclock rules: max debt, escalating costs, how to pay it off.
- TODO: add a switchroom checkpoint once at least 1 line is disabled.
