# Party Run: q7-conveyor-war / run-07

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 8
- classes: bard, rogue, paladin, druid, fighter
- tags: social-builds, roleplay-heavy, rescue-first

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they insist on "minimizing harm". They look for workers, survivors, and ways to do the job without collateral.
2. Switchroom: they interrogate the quest giver and demand a "safe shutdown plan". Bard extracts a map sketch (flavor reward).
3. First shutdown: they hear banging behind a door and choose to rescue trapped workers before pulling the lever. This costs time but feels heroic.
4. Traversal: druid handles hazards by creating safe spots (flavor), rogue scouts, fighter and paladin take turns front-lining.
5. Second shutdown: they choose a slower but safer route to avoid dragging fights across belts.
6. Boss: they attempt to "talk" to Foreman Clank. It doesn’t work, but it triggers an alternate add pattern (this would be a cool feature).
7. Resolution: they feel satisfied, but they want the moral choice to be explicit and rewarded (rep).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: reliable advance under pressure; makes rescue possible.
- rogue: scouting and door access; turns rescue from suicidal to doable.
- cleric: no cleric in party; they feel the lack during long hazard segments.
- wizard: no wizard in party; turret corridors require patience and cover.
- ranger: no ranger in party; would shine in long corridors picking off threats during rescues.
- paladin: the "rescue-first" anchor; moral framing that makes the adventure feel different.
- bard: extracts intel, coordinates party, and turns the run into a story.
- druid: hazard mitigation and "factory ecology" flavor; turns machinery into something you can interact with.
- barbarian: no barbarian in party; would shine ripping doors open under time pressure.
- warlock: no warlock in party; would complicate rescue ethics with bargain options.
- sorcerer: no sorcerer in party; would shine deleting adds so rescues are safer.
- monk: no monk in party; traversal is slower and less stylish.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Rescue choice needs explicit support: NPCs, reward (rep), and a time trade.
- Boss "talk attempt" should be an explicit alternate trigger (even if it mostly fails).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an optional worker-rescue sub-objective tied to shutdown pacing and rewards.
- TODO: add a "nonlethal / minimal harm" framing path (even if outcomes converge).
