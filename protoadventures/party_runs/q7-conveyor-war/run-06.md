# Party Run: q7-conveyor-war / run-06

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: all 7 (under-leveled)
- classes: paladin, rogue, cleric
- tags: under-leveled, cautious, no-caster

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: paladin wants to "make the factory safe", rogue wants the loot, cleric wants to stop the bleeding.
2. Entry: turret corridors are punishing without wizard tools. Rogue finds a side vent that reduces exposure (this becomes the run's secret).
3. Shutdown 1: they succeed, but slowly. Cleric rationing becomes the run's pacing mechanism.
4. Foundry: heat vents plus tight rooms almost wipe them; paladin uses a defensive cooldown to escort them through.
5. Shutdown 2: the wave spawns behind them and they barely survive by retreating into the vent route again.
6. Shutdown 3: they learn to pull enemies away from belts before starting the objective.
7. Boss: they attempt once, wipe, and come back after re-clearing the last corridor. Second attempt is clean because they assign roles: paladin holds center, rogue assassinates add caller, cleric sustains.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: no fighter in party; would reduce the resource drain holding corridors.
- rogue: the secret vent route is the reason they can progress; also the add-caller killer.
- cleric: the run's battery; if cleric mis-times heals, they wipe.
- wizard: no wizard in party; turret corridors feel like the hardest wall.
- ranger: no ranger in party; would help with turret/belt-runner pressure from range.
- paladin: moral spine and defensive escort through hazards.
- bard: no bard in party; would help coordinate pacing and keep morale after wipes.
- druid: no druid in party; would help with hazard mitigation in foundry.
- barbarian: no barbarian in party; would shine in lever-rip objective moments.
- warlock: no warlock in party; would shine in overclock bargain to shorten waves.
- sorcerer: no sorcerer in party; would shine deleting add waves quickly.
- monk: no monk in party; traversal is slower and riskier.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Re-clearing after a wipe is the worst part. Needs a mid-run checkpoint or safer reset.
- Without a caster, turret corridors must have at least one alternate counterplay route.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a switchroom "checkpoint unlock" after shutdown 2 (opens a safe return corridor).
- TODO: codify the vent route as a deliberate secret with consistent tells.
