# Party Run: q7-conveyor-war / run-03

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 9
- classes: fighter, paladin, barbarian, monk, rogue
- tags: all-melee, first-time, stubborn

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they take the job to prove melee can clear the factory "without wizard babysitting".
2. Entry: the first turret corridor is misery. They learn the hard lesson: sometimes the right play is to break line-of-sight and wait out pressure.
3. Line shutdown 1: they clear the wave, but only after paladin and fighter coordinate a "rotate who eats turret fire" plan.
4. Conveyor traversal: monk and rogue cross first and secure a safe square; barbarian tries to leap and gets knocked back twice. They start treating belts as mini-bosses with their own timing.
5. Line shutdown 2: brute force works until it doesn't. An add wave spawns behind them and deletes rogue. They recover, but it costs most resources.
6. Secret: they accidentally find a catwalk (quiet route) by following a maintenance sign and discover it bypasses one belt segment. This makes them feel smart.
7. Line shutdown 3: barbarian has a hero moment ripping a jammed lever free while fighter holds the doorway.
8. Boss: they win by treating the arena as zones: paladin anchors center, monk handles adds, rogue hunts the add caller. They almost wipe once to a knockback into hazard.
9. Resolution: they call it "melee viable but you need cover language everywhere."

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: anchors every choke; the party advances when the fighter says "now".
- rogue: finds/leverages the catwalk route; also the add-caller assassin in boss.
- cleric: no cleric in party; lack of sustain is constantly felt.
- wizard: no wizard in party; turret rooms are the run's hardest problem.
- ranger: no ranger in party; would have trivialized belt-runner kiting.
- paladin: the moral leader and the stabilizer in arena; "we do not panic".
- bard: no bard in party; would shine calling rotations and timing belts.
- druid: no druid in party; would shine mitigating hazard zones and knockback.
- barbarian: lever-rip hero moment; also eats risk when timing belts.
- warlock: no warlock in party; would shine in optional overclock bargain.
- sorcerer: no sorcerer in party; would shine deleting add waves.
- monk: traversal captain; saves the run by moving correctly.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Turrets need a clearer rule: how to disable, avoid, or outplay (right now it feels like "suffer until next room").
- Conveyors need more consistent telegraphs (belt speed, safe squares, knockback direction).
- Melee needs one explicit "counter-turret" tool path (shield, smoke, scrap cover).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: formalize the "quiet route" catwalk as the factory secret (consistent signage + payoff).
- TODO: add a non-caster answer to turret corridors (cover objects, shield consoles, smoke valves).
