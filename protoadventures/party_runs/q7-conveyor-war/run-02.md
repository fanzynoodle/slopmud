# Party Run: q7-conveyor-war / run-02

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: all 7 (under-leveled)
- classes: barbarian, sorcerer, ranger
- tags: under-leveled, no-healer, speedrun

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they accept the job because the pay is high and they want Underrail access fast.
2. Plan: "skip fights, hit objectives." This fails immediately because the factory doesn't let you ignore geometry.
3. First corridor: turret + bruiser pack. Barbarian eats damage; they limp through with no sustain.
4. Line shutdown 1: they try to brute-force the wave. Sorcerer bursts adds, but the bruiser interrupts; ranger kites until room is cleared.
5. Traversal: the belts separate the party. Barbarian gets knocked back twice and starts calling the belts "the real boss".
6. Line shutdown 2: they miss the intended lever room twice. Navigation becomes the run killer. They finally find it, but the wave spawns behind them and pins sorcerer.
7. Retreat: they pull back to reset, but without a safe alcove it’s "run until you find a dead belt".
8. Decision: they abandon line 3 and try to skip to the boss arena anyway; the boss gate is sealed. They feel the rules are consistent (good) but also punishing (needs better hinting).
9. Resolution: they go back, find line 3, and complete it on their last resources. They refuse to attempt the boss.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: hero moment holding the door while others cross belts; also the clearest example of "no-healer makes this brutal".
- sorcerer: burst saves them from being overwhelmed twice, but cooldown windows are too punishing without sustain.
- ranger: the only reason they don’t wipe is kiting and target priority calls.
- fighter: no fighter in party; would replace "barbarian as door" with reliable control.
- rogue: no rogue in party; would have prevented the navigation failure by finding the quiet route.
- cleric: no cleric in party; the absence is the story of this run.
- wizard: no wizard in party; turret rooms feel unfair without control tools.
- paladin: no paladin in party; would shine if we add a worker-rescue option during the run.
- bard: no bard in party; would shine as coordinator and wipe-recovery leader.
- druid: no druid in party; would shine with hazard mitigation and "jam gears" utility.
- warlock: no warlock in party; would shine in optional overclock bargains for speed.
- monk: no monk in party; traversal would be dramatically smoother.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need stronger navigation language: floor arrows, color-coded line IDs, audible cues for "shutdown room nearby".
- Need at least one clearly-marked "safe alcove" between setpieces for parties without sustain.
- Need a clear hint that boss gate requires all three lines, so "skip to boss" fails fast.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add "factory map signage" patterns that players can learn (line 1/2/3 labels everywhere).
- TODO: define optional "heal station" or "coolant wash" between lines (limited uses).
- TODO: for no-healer parties, add an alternate objective path that trades time for safety.
