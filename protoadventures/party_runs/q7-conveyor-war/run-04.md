# Party Run: q7-conveyor-war / run-04

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 8
- classes: wizard, cleric, warlock, sorcerer, bard
- tags: all-casters, cautious, lore-hounds

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they accept the job because the switchroom NPC hints at Underrail access and "forbidden diagrams".
2. Entry: turret corridors are easy for them. Wizard turns LOS into a puzzle; bard calls safe positions.
3. Line shutdown 1: they over-control and under-damage. The wave takes too long, and they nearly run out of resources.
4. Traversal: belts are less scary because they can control space, but they still get punished for splitting.
5. Line shutdown 2: warlock does an "overclock bargain" with a console to shorten the wave (they accept a debuff / debt token).
6. Foundry hazard: heat vents apply a stacking burn. Cleric becomes the MVP clearing statuses.
7. Line shutdown 3: sorcerer bursts the add wave and it feels incredible. They realize the factory is a burst-check if you let it be.
8. Boss: they win cleanly by identifying the add-caller mechanic early and keeping the arena calm.
9. Resolution: they leave with diagrams, a debt token, and a strong desire for more optional lore in industrial zones.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: no fighter in party; would shine holding corridors without spending spell resources.
- rogue: no rogue in party; would shine finding quiet routes and disabling locks without magic.
- cleric: clears heat/burn stacks and prevents slow attrition wipes.
- wizard: makes turret corridors solvable and safe; "control is the strategy".
- ranger: no ranger in party; would shine in belt-runner picks and long corridors.
- paladin: no paladin in party; would shine protecting workers and "hold the line" moments.
- bard: coordinates movement and keeps comms clean; turns chaos into cadence.
- druid: no druid in party; would shine in hazard mitigation and "jam gears" utility.
- barbarian: no barbarian in party; would shine in lever-rip objective under fire.
- warlock: the optional bargain: faster shutdown for a lingering debt token.
- sorcerer: the burst moment: deletes add wave and saves the run.
- monk: no monk in party; traversal would be even safer with a scout.

## Friction / Missing Content

- The "bargain" needs a consistent UX: opt-in, explicit cost, and a persistent marker so it matters.
- Foundry hazards need strong description text so players understand what is happening.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define "industrial bargain" pattern (overclock consoles) and what it costs (rep, debt, debuff).
- TODO: add 1-2 lore objects that reward curious players in switchroom/foundry.
