# Party Run: q7-conveyor-war / run-09

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 8
- classes: ranger, ranger, rogue, monk, sorcerer
- tags: ranged-heavy, kite-first, fast-clear

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they want Underrail fast and treat the factory as a speed course.
2. Entry: corridor packs evaporate under ranged focus; rogue calls targets, sorcerer deletes the backline.
3. Shutdown 1: they succeed fast, but their kiting almost drags a second pack into the setpiece. They learn the factory punishes sloppy pulls.
4. Shutdown 2: ranger pair is MVP: belt-runners never get to cause chaos.
5. Shutdown 3: monk scouts the catwalk route; they use it to bypass the most dangerous belt segment (secret).
6. Boss: add call is the only real threat. Sorcerer saves the run by bursting the add wave before it snowballs.
7. Resolution: they rate the adventure "high tempo, low patience." They want a leaderboard-style reward for clean clears.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: no fighter in party; would make mistakes less lethal by anchoring chokes.
- rogue: target caller and route-finder; keeps the kite from becoming chaos.
- cleric: no cleric in party; they gamble on speed instead of sustain.
- wizard: no wizard in party; turret corridors are still solvable via speed and picks.
- ranger: signature ranger run: pick threats at range; control the tempo.
- paladin: no paladin in party; would shine in rescue-first version of this adventure.
- bard: no bard in party; would shine in cadence and morale after mistakes.
- druid: no druid in party; would shine in hazard mitigation (belts/vents).
- barbarian: no barbarian in party; would shine in lever-rip hero moments.
- warlock: no warlock in party; would shine in optional overclock bargains.
- sorcerer: burst makes the boss fight feel clean and earned.
- monk: traversal + scouting; prevents accidental wipes to geometry.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a clear "pull leash" rule so speed parties can learn how not to chain-pull into objectives.
- Optional "clean clear" reward hook would be motivating.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define a factory "alert level" that increases if you chain-pull into shutdown rooms.
- TODO: add a speedrun/perfect-clear reward (cosmetic or token).
