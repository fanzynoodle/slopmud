# Party Run: q7-conveyor-war / run-05

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: all 10 (over-leveled)
- classes: fighter, cleric, ranger, wizard
- tags: over-leveled, bored-test, efficient

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they accept because it's on the way; they expect to faceroll.
2. Entry: they do, until belts start knocking them into hazards. They realize level doesn't fix geometry.
3. Shutdowns: waves melt. The only interesting part is "did we do the objective fast enough to avoid extra spawns?"
4. Boss: boss dies quickly, but only after one surprise add call forces them to respect the mechanic.
5. Resolution: they report the run was "too easy in damage, still fun in traversal."

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: mostly redundant at this level, except for holding position in knockback moments.
- rogue: no rogue in party; would have sped up route-finding even further.
- cleric: provides safety net, but no one is close to dying except from hazards.
- wizard: controls space, but raw power trivializes most of the content.
- ranger: shines picking belt-runners before they cause extra pulls.
- paladin: no paladin in party; would shine if there are worker-rescue choices with rep.
- bard: no bard in party; would shine turning the run into a "perfect clear" with timing calls.
- druid: no druid in party; would shine interacting with machinery hazards.
- barbarian: no barbarian in party; would shine in objective hero moments if they exist.
- warlock: no warlock in party; would shine in optional speed bargains (overclock).
- sorcerer: no sorcerer in party; would shine in speedrun burst clears.
- monk: no monk in party; would make traversal even cleaner.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a higher-difficulty optional path so over-leveled parties have something to bite on.
- The boss needs one mechanic that ignores raw damage (e.g., a shield phase tied to adds).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an optional "hard mode" shutdown (extra line) or a loot room behind a risk switch.
- TODO: add a boss phase that requires handling a mechanic, not just DPS.
