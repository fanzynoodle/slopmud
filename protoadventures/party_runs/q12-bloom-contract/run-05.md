# Party Run: q12-bloom-contract / run-05

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 15
- classes: wizard, warlock, sorcerer, rogue, ranger
- tags: no-healer, all-ranged, control-heavy, clean

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they treat spores as the real boss and plan around not having sustain.
2. Wilds: ranger marks safe routes; rogue scouts; casters keep packs at distance in clear squares.
3. Grove 1: they farm it clean by controlling mites and only harvesting in lulls.
4. Decontam safe pocket is used as a "reset between groves" station.
5. Grove 2: they solve the vine labyrinth as a line-of-sight problem. Rogue harvests, others provide overwatch.
6. Grove 3: caretaker drone heal cycle becomes a burst check: sorcerer/wizard focus windows, warlock saves big hit for heal trigger.
7. Root Engine: they win by never letting spore stacks climb; control adds, burst windows, move on lulls.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: primary control; makes encounters safe by deleting approaches.
- warlock: burst window specialist; also a natural bio-pact option.
- sorcerer: high tempo on caretaker windows; keeps cycles short.
- rogue: harvest + scouting; keeps the run from turning into a slog.
- ranger: navigation and long sightline threat removal.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Spore rules must be consistent enough for "no-healer" parties to play perfectly and win.
- Need clear language for which rooms are safe to "wait out" pulses vs which will spawn reinforcements if you stall.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define "stalling" rules per grove: safe wait vs spawn escalation.
- TODO: make caretaker heal triggers obvious and learnable.
