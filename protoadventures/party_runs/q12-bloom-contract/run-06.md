# Party Run: q12-bloom-contract / run-06

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 14
- classes: bard, cleric, paladin, rogue, druid
- tags: social-build, diplomacy, preserve-first

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they try to renegotiate the contract to avoid burning sections of the biome.
2. Greenhouse hub: bard gets better pay and a staff escort token; rogue gets a map to maintenance tunnels.
3. Wilds: they avoid a big fight by showing the escort token at a caretaker checkpoint (non-combat bypass).
4. Grove 1: druid takes point and "talks to the machine" for a clue about lulls; cleric manages spore stacks.
5. Grove 2: paladin refuses to burn a vine wall; they take the longer safe route instead.
6. Grove 3: caretaker drone escalates when they refuse sanitation directives. They win by focusing on the harvest objective and disengaging cleanly.
7. Root Engine: they choose "preserve" options that keep the biome stable but make the fight slightly longer; bard coordination makes it fine.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- bard: contract renegotiation and bypass token; cadence calling in fights.
- cleric: spore cleanse and stabilization; keeps social party from collapsing in combat.
- paladin: hard choice moments (burn vs preserve) with consequences.
- rogue: uses the map to find tunnels; harvest timing.
- druid: the big druid moment: interface with the garden machine for hints/boons.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need at least one explicit non-combat bypass for social parties (escort token, staff favor, or correct dialogue).
- Preserve/burn choice must have visible consequences (shorter fight vs rep/biome stability).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a caretaker checkpoint that can be bypassed via negotiation token.
- TODO: define preserve/burn consequence knobs (tempo vs reputation).
