# Party Run: q12-bloom-contract / run-03

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 16 (top of band)
- classes: paladin, bard, druid, sorcerer, monk
- tags: over-leveled, fast, low-friction

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they treat it like a "biome raid" and immediately ask if there is a hard mode.
2. They clear wilds packs quickly; spore stacks exist but never reach danger.
3. Grove 1-3: they speed-harvest, burst caretaker drone cycles, and barely need the safe pocket.
4. Root Engine: the only meaningful pressure. They win by coordinating burst in exposure windows.
5. Resolution: they want optional knobs: "mutations", "angry biome", "caretaker escalation" to make reruns interesting.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: frames the "protect the biome" choice; acts as a moral anchor for burn vs preserve.
- bard: makes the run clean by coordinating harvest windows and calling lulls.
- druid: interfaces with the garden machine and gets a non-combat path hint (feels like the druid moment).
- sorcerer: deletes caretaker heal windows; makes the cycle a skill check.
- monk: movement solves vine maze segments without taking spore pulses.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need optional difficulty knobs for over-leveled parties: extra caretaker wave, faster spore pulses, elite patrols.
- Root Engine needs a "punish sloppy play" pattern even at high level (geometry/hazards).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an opt-in "Angry Biome" toggle (more spores, more patrols, better rewards).
- TODO: add one non-damage failure state in Root Engine (e.g., sample contamination).
