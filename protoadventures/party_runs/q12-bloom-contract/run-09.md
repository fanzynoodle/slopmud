# Party Run: q12-bloom-contract / run-09

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: all 15
- classes: fighter, cleric, wizard
- tags: small-party, steady, resource-tight

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they accept knowing it will be slower with only three.
2. Wilds: every pull matters; wizard control is mandatory; fighter must hold perfectly; cleric must ration sustain.
3. Grove 1: they succeed but take spore stacks because there is no rogue/ranger to scout and pull clean.
4. Decontam chamber is essential; without it they would have hard stalled.
5. Grove 2: they almost wipe when a caretaker patrol joins mid-harvest. They learn to reset and take fights in funnels.
6. Grove 3: they solve it by doing "clear then harvest" in strict steps, even if it costs time.
7. Root Engine: they win, but barely, and it highlights the need for a safe pocket close to the arena for small parties.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: single point of failure; holds funnels and prevents the wizard from being overrun.
- cleric: ration sustain; makes spore stacks recoverable.
- wizard: carries navigation and control; turns 3vN into a solvable series.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Small parties need a little more "room to breathe": one extra funnel, one extra safe pocket, or fewer simultaneous adds.
- Need explicit reset points so a 3-person group can avoid chaining pulls.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a near-arena shelter pocket (or checkpoint) for small parties.
- TODO: ensure each grove has a "clear square" funnel option.
