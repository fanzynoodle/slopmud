# Party Run: q12-bloom-contract / run-07

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 15
- classes: druid, ranger, cleric, wizard, fighter
- tags: nature-forward, lore-hounds, clean

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they ask "what happened to this biome" and want lore, not just samples.
2. Greenhouse hub: druid finds a dormant interface node and learns that the gardens are layered over ancient machinery.
3. Grove 1: they harvest with minimal fighting; ranger uses signs to avoid patrol loops.
4. Grove 2: wizard and druid work together: geometry and ecology clues point to the safe path through vines.
5. Grove 3: caretaker drone offers a bargain: "take fewer samples, but accept a contamination tag." They refuse.
6. Root Engine: druid uses the interface node mid-fight to change hazard cadence once (one-time "machine speaks" moment).
7. Resolution: they return with samples and a lore packet; greenhouse adds a new NPC line about the Root Engine.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- druid: interfaces with the garden machine; gets a meaningful non-combat and combat lever.
- ranger: navigation and patrol avoidance; makes the run feel like competence.
- cleric: keeps spore management legible and prevents attrition deaths.
- wizard: solves vine geometry with control; makes setpieces readable.
- fighter: anchors the team when the wilds try to turn into a kite-fest.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a "garden machine interface" interaction that is clearly optional and druid-forward.
- Lore rewards should be concrete (unlock a shortcut, reduce spore severity once, or add a safe pocket hint).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a greenhouse interface node with a 1-use "shift cadence" lever.
- TODO: add lore packet reward hooks (not just text).
