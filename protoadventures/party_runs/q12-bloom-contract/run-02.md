# Party Run: q12-bloom-contract / run-02

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: all 13 (under band)
- classes: barbarian, rogue, wizard, warlock
- tags: under-leveled, no-healer, reckless, wipe-once

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they take the contract because it gates The Core, not because they like gardening.
2. They ignore greenhouse warnings and treat spores like flavor. First wilds pull stacks them up fast.
3. Bloom Grove 1: they try to brute-force the harvest while standing in fog pulses. They wipe when mites + strider reach pin them in open terrain.
4. Reset: wizard proposes a rule: "harvest only during lull; fight only in clear squares; decon whenever possible."
5. Second attempt: rogue pulls packs into a narrow path; barbarian anchors; wizard controls; warlock bursts priority targets.
6. They only get two samples before the contract timer pressure becomes real (they are too slow without a safe pocket).
7. Bloom Grove 3 attempt: caretaker drone appears and they can't outlast its cycle without sustain. They retreat with two samples.
8. They negotiate partial pay and learn there should be a mid-run safe pocket and explicit spore rules.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: anchor + peel; proves that "open field" is a death sentence if you chase.
- rogue: makes the run possible by finding funnels and timing harvest attempts.
- wizard: primary survivability via control and navigation; makes a plan after wipe.
- warlock: burst windows matter; also a natural fit for bio-pact side bargains.
- fighter: no fighter; would shine holding grove perimeter.
- cleric: no cleric; party would have finished with one; this is the "no-healer pain" run.
- ranger: no ranger; navigation would be easier with one.
- paladin: no paladin; would shine in "burn vs preserve" moral choice with consequences.
- bard: no bard; would shine in contract negotiation and rule-setting.
- druid: no druid; would shine in interacting with the garden machine to reduce spore severity.
- sorcerer: no sorcerer; would shine in caretaker burst checks.
- monk: no monk; would shine in vine maze traversal.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a guaranteed decontam safe pocket after sample 1; otherwise under-leveled/no-healer parties hard stall.
- Spore pulses must be telegraphed (audio + text) with clear "lull windows".
- Caretaker drone must have a readable cycle and an intended counter (interrupt, focus, or mechanic).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add "Sample 1 unlocks decontam chamber" to make progress consistent.
- TODO: design a caretaker cycle counterplay that doesn't require a healer.
