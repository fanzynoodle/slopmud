# Party Run: q12-bloom-contract / run-04

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 14
- classes: fighter, barbarian, monk, paladin, rogue
- tags: all-melee, stubborn, learns-funnels

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: all-melee asks one question: "is there cover, or is this a ranged zone?"
2. Wilds: they get punished for chasing vine striders into open fog; they adapt by pulling back into terrain funnels.
3. Grove 1: mites + spore fog. Rogue harvests while fighter/paladin hold a narrow line; monk does cleanup; barbarian breaks a seed-vault door for a risk/reward side cache.
4. They rely heavily on the decontam safe pocket. Without it they would have stalled.
5. Grove 2: vine labyrinth turns into a movement puzzle. Monk shines; fighter anchors; paladin "burn vs preserve" choice becomes a vow moment.
6. Grove 3: caretaker drone's heal cycle forces them to coordinate focus; they win by committing to windows and not splitting.
7. Root Engine: melee has trouble when the arena punishes clustering. They learn to rotate positions and respect hazard lines.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: line-holder; makes melee viable by controlling space.
- barbarian: breaks open the seed-vault; also the "don’t chase into fog" lesson.
- monk: movement solves vine segments and avoids spore pulses.
- paladin: choice language (burn vs preserve) and party discipline in Root Engine.
- rogue: harvest under pressure; stealth routes through greenhouse tunnels.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Terrain funnels must be intentional and readable; otherwise melee feels punished by default.
- Root Engine needs clear hazard lines so melee knows where "safe squares" are.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add explicit "pull back to clear squares" signage/tutorial line in Grove 1.
- TODO: ensure at least one melee-friendly approach to each grove (funnels or cover pockets).
