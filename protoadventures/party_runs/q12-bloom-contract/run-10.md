# Party Run: q12-bloom-contract / run-10

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 14
- classes: barbarian, sorcerer, monk, rogue, ranger
- tags: chaotic, side-objectives, triggers-elites

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they accept but immediately decide to "steal extra seeds" from any vault they find.
2. Wilds: ranger keeps them from getting lost; rogue finds a vault; barbarian breaks it open and triggers an elite caretaker response.
3. Grove 1: they succeed but spend too many resources on the elite response; spore stacks climb.
4. Decontam chamber saves the run.
5. Grove 2: monk/sorcerer movement and burst make it possible, but they nearly wipe when they harvest during a pulse.
6. Grove 3: they finally respect lulls. Rogue harvests cleanly; ranger overwatch; sorcerer bursts caretaker windows.
7. Root Engine: they win, but the run shows side objectives need explicit risk/reward language and clear escalation rules.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: seed-vault smash; triggers consequences and teaches discipline.
- sorcerer: burst on caretaker windows; keeps cycles short.
- monk: movement through vine terrain; avoids spore pulses.
- rogue: finds vaults and harvests; stealth routes through tunnels.
- ranger: navigation and overwatch; prevents chaos from becoming a wipe loop.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Side objective escalation must be explicit (what triggers, how it escalates, how long it lasts).
- Harvest interaction needs to refuse/interrupt cleanly if a pulse starts (avoid gotcha wipes).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define vault escalation rule: elite response timing + cooldown.
- TODO: harvest UX: explicit "unsafe during pulse" messaging and interruption behavior.
