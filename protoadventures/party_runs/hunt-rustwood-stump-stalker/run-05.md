# Party Run: hunt-rustwood-stump-stalker / run-05

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 6/6/6/6
- classes: barbarian, fighter, monk, paladin
- tags: all-melee, no-tracker, formation, backline-protect

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the hunt without tracker classes and assumed "we'll just smash it when it appears."
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Stayed in a tight formation and used the monk as the "eyes" to scout corners so stealth bursts didn't isolate someone.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Relocations were slow to find. They kept running into extra packs because they didn't know which clue objects were real signals.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Second reveal: the stalker burst the monk and tried to retreat. Paladin anchored a fallback point while fighter/barbarian held adds, letting the monk rejoin instead of chasing alone.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Missed the trap setup entirely; no one knew where it would be offered without a ranger/rogue lead.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Won the lair fight, but it felt messy and overlong. Melee can solve it, but only if the clue path is learnable without specialist classes.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: anchored the regroup point and prevented "one guy chases and dies" syndrome.
- monk: corner scouting and pursuit discipline; didn't get baited into solo chasing.
- fighter: held adds off the group while they stabilized from bursts.
- barbarian: punished the stalker during the limited reveal windows and forced relocations on schedule.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Parties without tracker classes need a clear baseline clue path (not luck).
- Stealth burst needs a consistent tell so melee can pre-position, not just react to damage.
- Relocation clues should point forward, not sideways into extra packs that feel like punishment-only.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a "basic clue marker" visible to all parties (e.g. obvious sap + scratch icon).
- TODO: Add pre-burst tells with a consistent timing window for counterplay.
- TODO: Make relocation trails point to bounded forward rooms; avoid sending players into random side packs.
