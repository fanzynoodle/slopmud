# Party Run: hunt-rustwood-stump-stalker / run-07

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 5/5/5/5/5
- classes: rogue, ranger, cleric, fighter, wizard
- tags: under-leveled, first-time, wipe-once, slow-read

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the hunt as soon as they hit the level band and wanted the trophy reward.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Ranger/rogue tried to teach clue language to the others while moving; the party kept wanting to sprint and "just find it".
3. key fights / obstacles
   - First reveal caused a wipe: they split, ate a stealth burst, and then got pinned by extra packs because they chased the retreat path blindly.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Second attempt: they played patient. Rogue scouted, wizard controlled adds, fighter held a safe pocket, and cleric stabilized so the group could keep to the safe lane.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They found a trap setup option on attempt two, but skipped it to save time after the earlier wipe.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Completed the hunt with a messy lair finish. Under-leveled runs are viable, but only if clue readability and counterplay tells are extremely clear.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger/rogue: clue reading and path discipline; turned the second attempt into a solvable route.
- fighter: held the safe pocket when the party threatened to split again.
- cleric: recovered the party from burst panic and prevented spiral deaths.
- wizard: controlled adds so reveal windows stayed focused on the target.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Under-leveled groups need a louder "do not chase" warning after retreat; the first wipe felt like a lesson delivered too late.
- Stealth burst counterplay needs a clearer tell; otherwise the first reveal is a lottery.
- Extra packs on chase routes should be predictable and signposted, not surprise punishment.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a post-retreat warning callout: "It runs. Read the clue. Don't chase."
- TODO: Add a strong pre-burst tell and a brief "safe window" to react.
- TODO: Add clear chase-route signage (tracks leading into danger) and deterministic pack placement.
