# Party Run: hunt-rustwood-stump-stalker / run-09

## Party

- size: 2
- levels: 7/7
- classes: warlock, monk
- tags: mark-bargain, small-party, fast, dangerous

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Warlock accepted the mark bargain to reveal the target faster, even knowing it would make the run messier.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Monk tried to keep them on safe lanes, but the mark kept pulling reveals into awkward rooms, forcing constant re-routing.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Mark pressure stacked hazards/adds; they had to choose between "finish the reveal window" and "reset to avoid a death."
4. setpiece / spike
   - Second reveal nearly killed them: monk got bursted, warlock had to commit a risky slow to keep the stalker visible long enough to force the relocation threshold.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Missed trap setup; the mark route pushed them too fast past clue nodes.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Killed it in the lair with the mark debuff still active. Success, but it proved the bargain must be very explicit and capped.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- warlock: accepted the mark bargain and managed the cost instead of pretending it was free power.
- monk: pursuit discipline kept the duo from spiraling into chain pulls.
- warlock/monk: executed a "reveal, hit threshold, reset" loop that made small-party success possible.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Mark bargain needs clear UI: what it does, how long it lasts, and what risks it adds.
- Mark-driven reveals must not push players into truly random room pools; bounded chaos is fine, pure randomness is not.
- Small parties need a clear recovery lane after a bad reveal so one mistake isn't the end.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit mark bargain UI (benefit/cost/duration) and cap its stacking.
- TODO: Bound mark-driven reveal room pools and communicate the pool to players.
- TODO: Add a safe reset pocket between reveal rooms (short heal window / no adds) for small parties.
