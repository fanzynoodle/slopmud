# Party Run: hunt-rustwood-stump-stalker / run-10

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 8/8/8/8
- classes: ranger, barbarian, cleric, wizard
- tags: impatient, bad-chase, recovered, lair-lock

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the hunt and immediately decided to "go fast" instead of learning clues.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Bad chase moment: they followed the retreat path into a side grove and pulled extra packs, nearly turning the hunt into a messy dungeon crawl.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Ranger forced the reset by pointing out fresh clue objects and refusing to keep sprinting into unknown rooms.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Second reveal went well once they played disciplined: wizard controlled adds, cleric stabilized bursts, barbarian punished during the reveal window to force the relocation threshold.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Missed the fast trail shortcut because they spent early time recovering from the bad chase.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Lair unlock felt clear on this run: after relocation 2, the path forward was obvious. Clean lair kill after they stopped trying to speedrun blind.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger: forced clue discipline and stopped the panic chase spiral.
- wizard: add control made reveal windows meaningful instead of chaotic.
- cleric: stabilized stealth burst hits so one mistake didn't end the run.
- barbarian: punished hard during reveal windows to keep the hunt moving forward.

## Friction / Missing Content

- The game needs a louder "bad chase" warning before players enter the extra-pack side grove.
- Relocation/clue progression needs a clear progress indicator so players know they are moving forward.
- Fast trail shortcut should be discoverable even for first-timers (teach it, don't hide it).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a "bad chase" warning: obvious tracks into danger + audio cue when entering side pack zones.
- TODO: Add a relocation progress UI (relocations forced: 0/2, 1/2, 2/2).
- TODO: Add a first-time teach moment for the fast trail shortcut (ranger camp hint, trail marker).
