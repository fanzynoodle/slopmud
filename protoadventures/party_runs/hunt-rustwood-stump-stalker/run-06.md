# Party Run: hunt-rustwood-stump-stalker / run-06

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 7/7/7
- classes: wizard, sorcerer, bard
- tags: no-tracker, reveal-tools, control, panic-chase-avoid

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the hunt because they wanted a "pattern puzzle" and expected magic to substitute for tracking.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Wizard used temporary reveals to confirm clue nodes; bard called "stop and read" whenever the party started to sprint.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - They overpulled once by chasing the first retreat; learned that the hunt punishes panic chasing more than it punishes low damage.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Second reveal: sorcerer saved burst for the reveal window while wizard controlled adds; bard kept the group together so nobody ate a solo burst.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found a safe pocket route between clue nodes that avoids two pack clusters; it felt like the intended "patient mage" lane.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Successful lair kill, but only after they stopped treating reveals as a substitute for reading the environment.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: used reveals/controls to turn "unknown forest" into bounded lanes.
- bard: anti-panic leadership; kept the party from chain-pulling on retreat.
- sorcerer: burst discipline during the reveal window to force relocation thresholds.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Reveal tools can't be mandatory for non-tracker parties; there must be a baseline clue read.
- Retreat/chase punishment needs a warning language so it feels fair (fresh tracks, broken nests, etc).
- Lair entry needs a clear moment of unlock so parties know they're progressing.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add obvious baseline clue nodes for all parties, with optional extra detail for trackers.
- TODO: Add explicit "bad chase" warnings (visual trail + audio) before the extra-pack zones.
- TODO: Add a clear lair-unlock callout after relocation 2 (icon + ranger camp message).
