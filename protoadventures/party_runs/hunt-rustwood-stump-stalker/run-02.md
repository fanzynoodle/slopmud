# Party Run: hunt-rustwood-stump-stalker / run-02

## Party

- size: 2
- levels: 6/6
- classes: wizard, fighter
- tags: no-tracker, messy, chase-deaths

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took hunt without caring about clues; tried to brute force the target.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Chased into extra packs twice; learned the hunt punishes panic.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Without tracking tools, they wasted time finding relocation points and kept second-guessing which trail marks were meaningful.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Fighter had to bodyguard the wizard through two stealth bursts in a row.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Never found shortcuts; they didn't know the clue language and couldn't safely explore.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Eventually found the lair by following the only obvious trail marker; succeeded, but felt like it took too long for a duo.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: held the line when it ambushed the backline.
- wizard: reveal/mark utility made the hunt solvable even without tracker classes.
- fighter/wizard: learned to reset instead of chase, turning chaos into a bounded loop.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a fallback clue path for parties without ranger/rogue.
- "Bad chase" needs warning language so punishment feels fair, not arbitrary.
- Lair entry must be discoverable, not pure luck or "only if you already know."

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a basic fallback clue marker visible to all parties.
- TODO: Add "bad chase" warning language (broken branches, fresh blood, louder track icons).
- TODO: Ensure lair entry is clearly signposted after relocation 2 (unlock callout + trail marker).
