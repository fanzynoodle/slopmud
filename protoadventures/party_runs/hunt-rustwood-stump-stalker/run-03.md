# Party Run: hunt-rustwood-stump-stalker / run-03

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 9/9/8/8/8
- classes: warlock, druid, barbarian, bard, monk
- tags: mark-bargain, chaotic, fast

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Warlock accepted a "mark" to reveal the stalker faster.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Chased aggressively and accepted extra packs as the price of speed; bard tried to keep them from splitting.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Mark made reveals frequent but increased hazard pressure (explicit cost). They had to choose when to reset vs commit.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Barbarian finished the stalker in melee as it tried to flee; big rage moment.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Monk found a pursuit shortcut via trails; helped avoid one bad pull.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Fast kill, but messy; got base reward and a mark debuff that lingered.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- warlock: opt-in mark bargain that changed the run.
- barbarian: melee finish moment during a limited reveal window.
- monk: pursuit positioning through trails and shortcut discovery.
- druid: reduced chase chaos by controlling space and reading patterns.
- bard: coordination kept the party from chain-pulling into disaster.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Mark bargain must be explicit and capped; otherwise it's just delayed punishment.
- Fast chase route should still be learnable (bounded room pool), not random chaos.
- Reveal windows need a clear start/end so burst timing feels skillful.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Define mark bargain UI and cap stacking/duration.
- TODO: Add explicit "fast route" trail shortcuts with visible tells and bounded consequences.
- TODO: Add reveal window callouts (audio/visual) so parties know when to commit burst.
