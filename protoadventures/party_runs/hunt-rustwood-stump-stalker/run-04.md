# Party Run: hunt-rustwood-stump-stalker / run-04

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 8
- classes: ranger
- tags: solo, trap, patient, clean-kill

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the hunt at the ranger camp and asked for "the clue language, not the bravado speech."
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Cleared only the safe lane packs and refused to chase into unknown groves. Marked the relocation pool on a hand map.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - First reveal nearly became a panic chase, but the ranger chose to disengage when the stalker retreated instead of sprinting after it.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Set a trap at the second clue node. When the stalker revealed, the trap forced a longer damage window and prevented a backline burst.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found a "fast trail" shortcut between clue nodes, but intentionally didn't take it; it crossed a high-pack-density grove.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Clean lair finish. Solo felt viable because clues were consistent and the relocation pool wasn't random.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger: read clue language quickly and predicted the relocation pool.
- ranger: trap setup created a fair damage window and prevented stealth burst deaths.
- ranger: disciplined disengage; didn't panic chase into extra packs.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Solo needs a clear fallback if trap tools aren't chosen; otherwise one build becomes mandatory.
- Relocation pool needs explicit "it can only go to these rooms" language so learning feels real.
- Stealth burst counterplay needs a loud tell (audio/shimmer) so the solution isn't clairvoyance.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add an explicit relocation pool hint in the contract UI (2-3 possible zones).
- TODO: Add strong pre-burst tells (audio + visual shimmer) with a consistent timing window.
- TODO: Add a non-trap solo option (temporary reveal consumable or a safe-patience route reward).
