# Party Run: hunt-rustwood-stump-stalker / run-08

## Party

- size: 2
- levels: 9/9
- classes: rogue, druid
- tags: over-leveled, fast, trap, clean-finish

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the hunt to farm the trophy and test whether the loop stays interesting when over-leveled.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Rogue sprint-scouted clue nodes while druid cleared only what was necessary to keep safe pockets open.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Even over-leveled, the stealth burst was dangerous if ignored; they respected the tells and didn't get greedy.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Trap at clue 2 gave a clean reveal window. They forced relocations quickly and reached the lair with minimal side fighting.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Used a fast trail shortcut between clue nodes; it was readable and felt like a reward for knowing the route.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Clean lair kill. Reward felt fine, but the run highlighted the need for meaningful "clean kill" bonuses for skilled play.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- rogue: sprint-scout and trap setup; created the clean reveal window.
- druid: controlled the space and prevented accidental pack pulls during the chase moments.
- rogue/druid: executed the fast trail shortcut without turning it into chaos.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Fast trail shortcuts need consistent tells so they're learnable, not memorized secrets.
- Clean kill bonus should be explicit (what counts, what you get) to reward disciplined play.
- Relocation thresholds should be clear so parties know they're progressing.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add consistent shortcut tells (distinct plants, trail markers) for the fast route.
- TODO: Add explicit clean-kill criteria and bonus payout messaging.
- TODO: Add a progress indicator for relocation thresholds (2/2 relocations achieved).
