# Party Run: hunt-rustwood-stump-stalker / run-01

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 7/7/7
- classes: ranger, rogue, cleric
- tags: first-time, trap, patient

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took hunt at ranger camp and asked for clue language up front.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Cleared safe lanes before chasing; avoided chain pulls and treated clue rooms like checkpoints.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - First reveal nearly killed the cleric; rogue peeled and cleric learned to play behind cover instead of in the open.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Ranger set a trap at clue 2; it paid off by forcing the stalker to reveal longer.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Missed a fast route because they prioritized safety and never explored the risky grove lane.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Clean lair kill; got a bonus trophy item.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger: tracking + trap setup created a fair reveal window.
- rogue: peel and ambush control prevented burst deaths.
- cleric: stabilized stealth burst panic and kept the group from spiraling.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Clues must be readable enough for first-time parties without specialist knowledge.
- Stealth burst needs a telegraph (audio/shimmer) so counterplay is fair.
- Trap setup needs to be explicit (where/when) so it isn't a ranger-only secret.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add clear clue iconography at each clue node.
- TODO: Add stalker reveal tell (audio/shimmer) before burst with a consistent timing window.
- TODO: Ensure trap setup is an explicit option with visible payoff.
