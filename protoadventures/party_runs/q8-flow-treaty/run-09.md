# Party Run: q8-flow-treaty / run-09

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 9
- classes: ranger, ranger, rogue, monk, sorcerer
- tags: ranged-heavy, kite-first, fast-clear

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they want the Underrail unlock chain as fast as possible.
2. Shores: ranger duo deletes threats before they can pressure. Rogue calls pulls; monk keeps the party moving.
3. Nodes: they clear nodes cleanly, but almost fail an interact timer by dragging a fight into the node room.
4. Secret: monk finds a service ramp that bypasses a tunnel ambush (navigation reward).
5. Boss: sorcerer burst turns add windows into non-events. They win first try.
6. Resolution: they want a reward hook for "clean clears" (cosmetic, token, rep).

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- rangers: signature reservoir run; ranged threat management in wide spaces.
- rogue: pull discipline; prevents chain-pull mistakes.
- monk: traversal lead; finds shortcut.
- sorcerer: burst windows define boss success.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a consistent rule for "don’t drag fights into node rooms" (alert level or interact penalties).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define a reservoir "alert level" that escalates if you chain-pull into control nodes.
- TODO: add a clean-clear reward hook for fast, disciplined parties.
