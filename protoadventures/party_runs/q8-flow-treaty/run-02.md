# Party Run: q8-flow-treaty / run-02

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: all 8 (under-leveled)
- classes: barbarian, monk, sorcerer
- tags: under-leveled, no-healer, speedrun

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they take it for the unlock, not the story. "Restore nodes fast, skip fights."
2. Shores: speed works until it doesn’t. They chain-pull and get pinned in an open room with nowhere to break LOS.
3. Node A: they rush interact and trigger extra adds. Sorcerer bursts, but without sustain they are playing on a knife edge.
4. Tunnels: monk leads, avoids ambush bends, and saves the run by not letting them stop.
5. Node B: barbarian brute-forces a stuck valve crank mid-wave (hero moment). They barely survive.
6. Node C: they miss a map hint, wander, and waste time. Navigation is the biggest threat, not mobs.
7. Boss gate: they try to enter boss chamber with only 2 nodes restored. Gate is sealed. They appreciate the rule, but want a clearer hint earlier.
8. They restore node C, but now too low on resources to attempt boss. They leave.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: objective hero moment: forcing a stuck crank while under attack.
- monk: traversal captain; makes tunnels survivable.
- sorcerer: burst saves them from add snowballs repeatedly.
- cleric: no cleric; the absence is the run.
- wizard: no wizard; add waves are harder without control.
- ranger: no ranger; wide rooms feel riskier without ranged threat removal.
- paladin: no paladin; would shine in stabilizing and protecting the party.
- bard: no bard; would reduce navigation failures with better coordination.
- druid: no druid; would help with hazard mitigation and optional nonlethal routes.
- warlock: no warlock; optional "power draw" bargain could tempt this party.
- fighter: no fighter; holding an interact point is harder with pure melee.
- rogue: no rogue; they miss secrets and waste time.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a readable "boss gate requires 3/3 nodes" hint at the pump station and at the door.
- Need at least one safe mid-run reset pocket for no-healer parties.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add explicit gate messaging everywhere (node count requirements).
- TODO: add an alternate slower/safer route that trades time for fewer ambushes.
