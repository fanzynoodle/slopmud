# Party Run: q8-flow-treaty / run-04

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 9
- classes: wizard, cleric, warlock, sorcerer, bard
- tags: all-casters, lore-hounds, cautious

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they treat it as a negotiation: "restore flow without killing everything that lives here."
2. Pump station: bard squeezes extra context from the NPC: there are "district quotas" and politics behind the request.
3. Shores: wizard controls wide pulls; sorcerer deletes ranged threats; they feel powerful.
4. Node A: they solve it cleanly and learn the interact timing.
5. Node B: warlock takes an optional "power draw" bargain to make the node faster to restore (debt token / rep hit).
6. Node C: cleric becomes MVP cleansing waterborne debuffs and preventing attrition.
7. Boss: they win first try by respecting phase shifts and saving burst for add windows.
8. Resolution: they want the bargain costs to be explicit and persistent, not hand-wavy.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: turns the reservoir into a solvable space; controls wide pulls.
- cleric: makes hazards manageable; cleanse is the run.
- bard: extracts lore and coordinates node order; keeps comms calm.
- warlock: optional bargain that changes pacing and adds story texture.
- sorcerer: burst windows delete add waves before they become pressure.
- fighter: no fighter; would shine anchoring nodes without spending resources.
- rogue: no rogue; secret routes are harder to find.
- ranger: no ranger; would shine picking threats at range without spell cost.
- paladin: no paladin; would shine in "protect districts" morality beat.
- druid: no druid; would shine in nonlethal interactions with reservoir life.
- barbarian: no barbarian; would shine brute-forcing stuck valves.
- monk: no monk; traversal is slower and riskier without a scout.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Bargain UX needs standardization: opt-in, explicit cost, persistent marker.
- Node interact text must be loud and unambiguous.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: define "power draw" bargains as a reusable pattern (debt tokens, rep cost, hazard changes).
- TODO: add one lore object per node to reward curiosity without slowing the run.
