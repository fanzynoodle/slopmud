# Party Run: q8-flow-treaty / run-05

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: all 11 (over-leveled)
- classes: fighter, cleric, ranger, wizard
- tags: over-leveled, bored-test, efficient

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they take it for the unlock; expect to faceroll.
2. Shores: mobs melt, but hazards still matter. They learn geometry ignores level.
3. Nodes: all three are fast. The only interesting beat is the interact timing and surge telegraphs.
4. Boss: boss HP is not the issue; phase shifts are. They respect adds and win cleanly.
5. Resolution: they want an optional hard mode so high-level parties have a bite.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger: still shines picking threats and preventing chain pulls.
- wizard: makes boss phase mechanics trivial to handle cleanly.
- cleric: mostly idle except for hazard cleanses.
- fighter: mostly redundant except for anchoring objective points.
- others: absent; the adventure needs optional difficulty knobs for experienced parties.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Lack of optional difficulty: no reason to take risks for better rewards.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add an optional "fourth node" hard mode with better rewards.
- TODO: add a boss shield phase tied to add control so raw damage doesn’t skip mechanics.
