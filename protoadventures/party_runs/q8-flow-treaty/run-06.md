# Party Run: q8-flow-treaty / run-06

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: all 8 (under-leveled)
- classes: paladin, rogue, cleric
- tags: under-leveled, cautious, no-caster

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: paladin frames it as protecting districts; rogue wants secrets; cleric wants to prevent suffering.
2. Shores: slow, careful pulls. They hug cover and never fight in open waterline areas if avoidable.
3. Node A: success after one near-wipe. Cleric learns the cleanse cadence.
4. Tunnels: rogue finds a maintenance crawlspace that reduces ambush pressure (secret route).
5. Node B: hardest because far adds are annoying. They learn to lure them into corners.
6. Node C: they complete it, but the run is exhausting. They want a mid-run checkpoint.
7. Boss: two attempts. They win by prioritizing adds and using paladin defensive windows.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: defensive escort and moral framing; makes the party feel intentional.
- rogue: secret route discovery and ambush prevention.
- cleric: cleanse and sustain; without it, run is impossible.
- wizard: none; the absence makes add handling slower and riskier.
- ranger: none; would help with ranged threat control.
- fighter: none; would anchor objectives and reduce resource drain.
- monk: none; would make tunnels safer via scouting.
- bard/druid/barbarian/warlock/sorcerer: absent; see TODOs for class hooks.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Without casters/range, far adds feel like chores. Need consistent lure mechanics.
- Wipe recovery is demoralizing without a checkpoint pocket.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a clear "safe pocket" between node 2 and node 3 (short rest vibe).
- TODO: add explicit lure tools (noise maker, bait, lever) to pull far threats into melee range.
