# Party Run: q8-flow-treaty / run-10

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 9
- classes: warlock, barbarian, cleric, wizard, bard
- tags: bargain-heavy, chaotic, wipe-once

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: warlock wants to test "power draw" consoles; barbarian wants to smash something big.
2. Shores: wizard controls; barbarian overpulls; bard tries to keep comms coherent.
3. Node A: warlock takes a power draw bargain. Node restore is faster, but it adds a hazard pulse. They ignore it and nearly wipe.
4. Node B: they take a second bargain. Now hazards stack and the run becomes a punishment spiral. They wipe once in tunnels.
5. Regroup: bard sets a rule: no more bargains. Cleric rations resources and they stabilize.
6. Node C: done cleanly.
7. Boss: they win by saving burst for add windows and respecting phase shifts.
8. Resolution: bargains are fun if costs are loud, explicit, and capped.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- warlock: the bargain system’s poster child; pushes optional risk into explicit costs.
- barbarian: causes chaos, then redeems it by clearing add packs quickly.
- cleric: keeps the run alive through stacked hazards.
- wizard: converts chaos into solvable phases with control.
- bard: coordination is the true win condition after wipe.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Bargain costs must be explicit: debt token count, next consequence, how to pay down.
- Wipe recovery needs a less punishing path back (checkpoint pocket).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: codify "power draw" rules: max debt, escalating costs, paydown options.
- TODO: add a pump-station checkpoint unlock after node 2.
