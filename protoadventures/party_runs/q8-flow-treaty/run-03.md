# Party Run: q8-flow-treaty / run-03

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 9
- classes: fighter, paladin, barbarian, monk, rogue
- tags: all-melee, stubborn, hazard-respect

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: paladin frames it as protecting the town. Everyone agrees: "no hero deaths to water."
2. Shores: open pulls are rough without ranged control. They learn to pull back to cover and fight in smaller chunks.
3. Node A: works fine. Fighter anchors; rogue interrupts interact-traps by scouting.
4. Tunnels: monk leads. They assign roles: monk scouts, rogue checks corners, barbarian stays in the middle to catch ambushes.
5. Node B: hardest for melee. The node is on a platform with a hazard ring that punishes clustering. They adapt by rotating who holds the interact.
6. Secret: rogue finds a maintenance walkway that bypasses one tunnel ambush. This feels like the melee-friendly route.
7. Node C: they succeed but spend a ton of resources.
8. Boss: they wipe once to an add wave they can’t reach fast enough. Second attempt: paladin calls target priority and uses defensive windows to keep the party alive until adds are handled.
9. Resolution: they like the "geometry + objective" feel; they want one explicit anti-ranged/anti-turret moment later.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: anchors nodes and keeps the group cohesive.
- rogue: scouting and secret route; prevents ambush wipes.
- paladin: moral spine and defensive cadence during boss.
- barbarian: catches ambushes and brute-forces stuck mechanisms.
- monk: traversal mastery through tunnels; avoids attrition.
- cleric: no cleric; sustain is the limiting factor.
- wizard: no wizard; add waves require more time and risk.
- ranger: no ranger; wide rooms are harder.
- bard: no bard; would shine coordinating rotations on hazards.
- druid: no druid; would shine interacting with water life/hazards.
- warlock: no warlock; would shine with optional "power draw" bargains.
- sorcerer: no sorcerer; would shine deleting add waves.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Need a melee-friendly way to handle far adds (lure, line-of-sight bait, or pull levers).
- Hazard rings need readable text so players understand why they are taking damage.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add a consistent "cover" language in shore rooms so melee parties can create safe fights.
- TODO: add a boss add-spawn pattern that can be manipulated by player positioning.
