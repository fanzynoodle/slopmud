# Party Run: q8-flow-treaty / run-01

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 9
- classes: fighter, cleric, wizard, rogue, ranger
- tags: balanced, first-time, methodical

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: pump station requests help restoring three control nodes before the reservoir "cycles wrong" and floods the wrong districts.
2. Intake: they talk to the station lead, get three node IDs (A/B/C) and a sketch map: shores, tunnels, control ring.
3. Shores: first fights are wide pulls with ranged threats. Ranger shines picking off "pump guardians" before they stack pressure.
4. Control node A: they discover the pattern: stabilize the room (adds), then interact with the node while under periodic surges.
5. Tunnels: they learn tunnels are the ambush tax. Rogue scouts, calls "don’t stop in bends".
6. Control node B: wizard handles add waves with control; fighter anchors the interact point; cleric keeps the party stable.
7. Secret: they find a service hatch that reconnects to the pump station faster (feels smart, reduces backtracking).
8. Control node C: hardest node: mixed packs, hazards, and a "false interact" that spawns a wave if you rush.
9. Boss: Flow Regulator chamber. They wipe once to an unexpected phase shift (adds + hazard). Second attempt they win by treating adds as the fight.
10. Resolution: they return, get a stamped "flow treaty" token and a promised shortcut unlock later.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: holds the node interact zone; makes objectives possible under pressure.
- rogue: scouts tunnels and finds the service hatch shortcut.
- cleric: keeps the run from collapsing to attrition; cleanses waterborne debuffs.
- wizard: turns add waves into manageable chunks; makes boss phase shifts solvable.
- ranger: ranged threat control in wide rooms; avoids snowball pulls.
- paladin: no paladin in party; would shine in "protect districts" moral framing.
- bard: no bard in party; would shine coordinating node order and recovery after wipe.
- druid: no druid in party; would shine interacting with reservoir life / calming eels.
- barbarian: no barbarian in party; would shine forcing a stuck valve under fire.
- warlock: no warlock in party; would shine in optional power-draw bargains.
- sorcerer: no sorcerer in party; would shine bursting add waves during boss phases.
- monk: no monk in party; traversal through tunnels would be cleaner and safer.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Control nodes need very clear "interact started / interact interrupted / interact complete" text.
- Surges need consistent telegraphs so players learn "step out now".
- Tunnels need at least one explicit "safe pocket" so wipes don’t mean full re-clear.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: standardize control node setpiece UX (waves + interact timer + completion flag).
- TODO: codify the service hatch secret as a deliberate shortcut with readable tells.
