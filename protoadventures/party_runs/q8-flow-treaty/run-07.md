# Party Run: q8-flow-treaty / run-07

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: all 9
- classes: bard, paladin, druid, fighter, rogue
- tags: social-builds, rescue-first, roleplay-heavy

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. Hook: they refuse to treat reservoir life as enemies by default. They look for nonlethal options.
2. Pump station: bard negotiates: they will restore nodes but demand the station stop dumping waste into a tunnel wing (future rep hook).
3. Shores: druid tries to calm sump eels. Sometimes it works; sometimes it fails and becomes a fight. It’s a good "choice matters" beat.
4. Node A: they rescue a trapped technician before starting the interact (optional time cost).
5. Node B: they take the slow safe route and avoid an ambush section. Rogue feels smart.
6. Node C: they choose to destroy a corrupted control relay rather than restore it cleanly (fast but causes a later hazard).
7. Boss: they attempt to "treaty" the regulator. It fails, but it changes the add pattern into a more manageable rhythm.
8. Resolution: they feel like the reservoir is political, not just a dungeon.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- bard: negotiations and coordination; makes it feel like a treaty, not a chore list.
- paladin: moral anchor; makes choices feel meaningful.
- druid: signature druid beat: interact with reservoir life and water systems.
- fighter: objective anchor and rescue protection.
- rogue: route finding and safe pathing through tunnels.
- cleric/wizard/ranger/barbarian/warlock/sorcerer/monk: absent; see TODOs.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Nonlethal options need clear signaling and rewards (rep, shortcuts, services).
- "Changed add pattern" needs a consistent, documented mechanism.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: add explicit nonlethal interactions for druid/bard paths (calm, negotiate, reroute).
- TODO: define a boss "treaty attempt" trigger: it fails but changes the fight.
