# Party Run: q6-hillfort-signal / run-05

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 5/5/6/6
- classes: paladin, fighter, monk, bard
- tags: no-caster, social-build, tempo-play

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Negotiated a safehouse guarantee up front and asked for a "signal flare" if they needed extraction.
   - Tried to talk patrols down when possible (nonlethal intent).
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Followed signage and tried to infer which pylon was closest; wanted the bunker map to say "short/medium/long" routes.
   - Found the cache late, after wiping once, then used it as a comeback tool.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Pylon 3 hazards punished impatience; monk mobility made it the easiest for them.
   - Pylon 1 timer was tense because they lacked ranged control; bard support kept it stable.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Forced-interrupt antechamber taught them the reaction window.
   - Banner hall boss was fair, but they requested that the "call" has an audible cue distinct from normal attacks.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Cache was good; they wanted one extra "visual clue" in the courtyard that something is down there.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Safehouse unlock felt meaningful because they had wiped once; it read like permanent progress.
   - Rail pass was celebrated, but the teaser event should not look like "nothing happens".

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: framed the bunker deal as a duty; provided a clear "we retreat now" call that saved the run.
- fighter: held the narrow pylon 2 approach and prevented a collapse when waves overlapped.
- monk: solved pylon 3 hazard movement; became the "runner" who fixed positioning mistakes.
- bard: turned the no-caster comp into a workable sustain plan; enabled a second boss attempt.
- cleric: none (not in party)
- wizard: none (not in party)
- ranger: none (not in party)
- rogue: none (not in party)
- druid: none (not in party)
- barbarian: none (not in party)
- warlock: none (not in party)
- sorcerer: none (not in party)

## Friction / Missing Content

- The bunker needs a map prop that communicates route length, not just directions.
- The boss "call" should be unmistakable (audio + text), and the first time it happens should include one hint line.
- The secret cache should be discoverable without meta-knowledge (one extra clue is enough).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add route-length hints to the bunker map prop.
- TODO: Add distinct "call" telegraph and a one-time hint on the first summon.
- TODO: Add a courtyard clue for the cache entrance.
