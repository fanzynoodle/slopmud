# Party Run: q6-hillfort-signal / run-09

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 6/7/7
- classes: druid, bard, sorcerer
- tags: diplomacy-first, nonlethal-intent, lore-hounds

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Tried to negotiate an alternate solution: "can we relight pylons without fighting patrols".
   - Accepted when the patrol leader framed it as "stabilize routes so fewer fights happen later".
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Moved slowly and attempted to avoid fights. They wanted explicit "sneak route" options in the courtyard.
   - Took time in the cache and read the lore note; it successfully foreshadowed the call.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Pylon rooms forced conflict. They asked for a nonlethal lever: "disable patrol unit" instead of "kill".
   - Pylon 1 hold: they attempted a pacify style plan and failed; then switched to control tactics.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Forced-interrupt antechamber landed well. They treated it like a ritual they needed to disrupt.
   - Boss: they interrupted reliably and tried to spare adds when possible, which made the fight longer but interesting.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found the cache. Asked for a second "lore-only" secret that changes nothing mechanically but expands the hillfort story.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Report-in dialogue mattered to them. They wanted one more line about what the safehouse represents (why it's safe).
   - Rail teaser motivated them to continue because it implied the world has moving parts.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- druid: pushed for nonlethal framing and made environmental reading part of play.
- bard: got extra information out of the patrol leader and used it to set expectations.
- sorcerer: handled add control and tempo so the party could keep their roleplay intent.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- If we support nonlethal intent, we need minimal hooks: "disable", "drive off", "stun", or "power down" language.
- The bunker/report-in NPCs should explicitly tie actions to world-state (patrol routes stabilizing).
- Lore seekers want at least one optional room note beyond the consumable cache.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add optional nonlethal wording for patrol units and one alternative resolution line in report-in.
- TODO: Add one small lore-only secret in the hillfort cluster (no mechanical impact).
- TODO: Add one line explaining why the safehouse niche is protected.
