# Party Run: q6-hillfort-signal / run-04

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 5/6/6/6/7
- classes: wizard, warlock, sorcerer, ranger, cleric
- tags: all-ranged, glass-cannon, interrupt-focus

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the mission as a "control test": can they manage patrol waves without a frontliner.
   - Asked if pylons can be lit stealthily or if "starting the sequence" is loud.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Chose pylon 1 first to see the timer loop and establish their defensive plan.
   - Used the courtyard as a regroup point between every spoke (felt correct).
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Pylon 1: succeeded cleanly, but wanted clearer wave boundaries so they could time big cooldowns.
   - Pylon 2: archers were trivial; the interesting part was preventing a split when adds approached from both sides.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Forced-interrupt antechamber: worked well as a teaching moment; they immediately practiced "who interrupts first".
   - Banner hall boss: the call was consistently interrupted, so the room shifted into "positioning under pressure".
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found the cache. It felt fair, not mandatory, and was used as a refill before the boss.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Rail pass + teaser landed. They wanted the teaser to include a single actionable choice: "which line do we take later".

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: managed the pylon 1 hold by controlling approach lanes; called wave timings.
- warlock: took primary interrupt duty and never missed a call.
- sorcerer: deleted add clusters to keep the room from spiraling.
- ranger: handled the split approach on pylon 2 by picking priority targets quickly.
- cleric: kept the party from panic-drifting; stabilized between spokes and enabled a clean boss attempt.
- fighter: none (not in party)
- rogue: none (not in party)
- paladin: none (not in party)
- bard: none (not in party)
- druid: none (not in party)
- barbarian: none (not in party)
- monk: none (not in party)

## Friction / Missing Content

- Timer fights need readable cadence: wave boundaries, seconds remaining, and a clear "sequence started" cue.
- Banner hall should have a strong positional identity (cover, pillars, banner lines) so it is not just "open room with adds".
- The rail teaser should hint at future branching in one sentence, even if it stays locked.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit wave feedback and a "sequence start" cue in each pylon room.
- TODO: Add one or two terrain elements in the banner hall to create meaningful positioning.
- TODO: Add a single-line "future branch" hint at the rail timetable board.
