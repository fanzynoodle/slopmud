# Party Run: q6-hillfort-signal / run-07

## Party

- size: 3 (2 humans + 1 assist bot)
- levels: 6/6/6
- classes: ranger, wizard, bot:vanguard
- tags: bot-fill, two-humans, speedrun, route-optimized

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Accepted fast, asked only "does pylon progress persist if we die".
   - Chose to bring an assist bot up front to hit the target trio.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Followed the bunker board route-length hints: did medium -> short -> long to keep tempo.
   - Used the courtyard as a reset node; never felt lost.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Pylon 1: timer feedback made it possible to play aggressively without guessing.
   - Pylon 3: hazards were readable, but the party wanted one more line of warning before a big collapse.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Forced-interrupt antechamber taught the window. The wizard and ranger took turns; the bot never interrupted.
   - Boss was clean. The bot did predictable frontline behavior and did not steal spotlight moments.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Skipped the cache intentionally to keep speed. The courtyard clue still made them feel it existed.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Report in, then rail teaser. The teaser's "future branch" hint prompted planning for the next session.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- ranger: route-led the run and called target priority in split approaches.
- wizard: took primary interrupt duty and managed the boss call cleanly.
- bot:vanguard: held aggro in predictable ways and let humans solve the interesting parts.
- fighter: none
- rogue: none
- cleric: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Bot behavior must be intentionally simple. It should not interrupt or solve puzzles unless explicitly commanded.
- Hazard telegraphs should include one extra pre-warning for big spikes so speedrunners can still play clean.
- Pylon sequences should have consistent feedback across all three rooms (same phrasing, same counters).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Document "assist bot does not interrupt by default" in the setpiece boundary notes.
- TODO: Ensure consistent pylon feedback formatting across all three pylon rooms.
- TODO: Add a single extra warning line for the biggest pylon 3 debris event.
