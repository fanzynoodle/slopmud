# Party Run: q6-hillfort-signal / run-06

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 5/5/5/5/5
- classes: fighter, cleric, rogue, druid, wizard
- tags: brand-new, slow-play, completionist, secret-hunters

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Treated the bunker as a tutorial room: asked what "sealed" means and whether pylons persist if they leave.
   - Asked for a safe rest option before committing to the banner hall.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Cleared each spoke fully, then returned to the courtyard to check if anything changed.
   - Detoured to find secrets; found the cache because they were intentionally poking at every exit.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Pylon rooms were engaging, but they wanted the courtyard to change after each pylon so progress is obvious.
   - They had one "confusion moment" where they thought the banner hall had opened early due to room messaging.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Forced-interrupt antechamber prevented a wipe: they practiced interrupts in safety.
   - Boss fight succeeded, but they almost missed the report-in because they assumed the rail terminal was the end.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Cache was found. They requested a second, smaller secret: a one-way drop from banner approach back to courtyard.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Safehouse unlock felt like the reward, more than the rail pass.
   - The rail teaser motivated them to keep playing because it implied "events exist".

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- fighter: acted as tour guide for the team; kept fights orderly and prevented overpulls.
- cleric: made the slow-play style viable; cleaned up mistakes without drama.
- rogue: discovered the cache and validated that curiosity has payoff.
- druid: used environment framing to read hazard telegraphs and taught others what to look for.
- wizard: learned the interrupt cadence and called out timing windows in the boss fight.
- ranger: none (not in party)
- paladin: none (not in party)
- bard: none (not in party)
- barbarian: none (not in party)
- warlock: none (not in party)
- sorcerer: none (not in party)
- monk: none (not in party)

## Friction / Missing Content

- Courtyard should reflect progress after each pylon (lights, hum, signage updates).
- Banner hall opening state must be unambiguous: sealed message until 3 pylons, then a different message.
- Post-boss flow needs one explicit pointer: "report back" before the rail terminal.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a visible progress change in the courtyard after each pylon.
- TODO: Make sealed/unsealed banner hall messaging distinct and consistent.
- TODO: Add a single guidance line in the banner hall exit: "return to command to report in".
