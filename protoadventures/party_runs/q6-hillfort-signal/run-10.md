# Party Run: q6-hillfort-signal / run-10

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 5/6/6/7
- classes: barbarian, fighter, cleric, wizard
- tags: overpull, chaos, patrol-timing-test

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Accepted and immediately tried to brute-force the banner hall before doing pylons.
   - The sealed messaging prevented sequence-breaking and taught the gate rule.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Chose pylons based on vibes, not route-length hints. Backtracked heavily.
   - The courtyard feedback after each pylon prevented "are we making progress" frustration.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - They repeatedly overpulled in the courtyard. The patrol timing lesson landed: "wait, then move".
   - Pylon 1 timer fight punished overpulling and rewarded clean lane control.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Forced-interrupt antechamber was the turning point. The fighter learned the window and called it out.
   - Boss: the barbarian chased adds; the cleric kept them alive; the wizard and fighter handled interrupts.
   - They nearly wiped once when the interrupt captain got stunned; they requested a clear backup assignment tool.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They ignored the cache clue until the end. They did not need it, but liked that it existed.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Reporting in felt like a checkpoint after chaos.
   - The rail teaser event was satisfying because it was calm after a long fight sequence.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: deleted a dangerous wave when the party was out of position.
- fighter: became the interrupt captain and taught the window to the party.
- cleric: rescued repeated overpull mistakes and kept the run moving.
- wizard: maintained lane control in pylon holds and stabilized boss tempo.
- rogue: none
- ranger: none
- paladin: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- warlock: none
- sorcerer: none
- monk: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Patrol timing needs readable signaling: a sound or text cue when a patrol is about to intersect the courtyard.
- Interrupt assignment should be a concept in the UI/UX: "captain" and "backup" is enough.
- Overpull scenarios need an escape valve: a reliable retreat route that does not feel like a punitive reset.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add a readable patrol-intersection cue in the courtyard.
- TODO: Encourage an interrupt captain + backup assignment in the forced-interrupt room text.
- TODO: Ensure the retreat loop is clear and does not erase pylon progress.
