# Party Run: q6-hillfort-signal / run-08

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 5/5/6/6/7
- classes: cleric, paladin, warlock, rogue, monk
- tags: interrupt-struggle, greedy-loot, overconfident

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the job and immediately asked "where is the boss loot".
   - Skimmed the bunker brief and missed the emphasis on pylons controlling patrol routes.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Did pylons in the worst order for them (long backtrack first), then complained about travel time.
   - Ignored the courtyard clue for the cache until after the first boss wipe.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Pylon fights were fine, but they burned resources early trying to "speed clear" without understanding wave boundaries.
   - On pylon 2 they split, got pinched, and learned to regroup on the choke.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Forced-interrupt antechamber helped, but they still treated interrupts as optional.
   - Boss: they let two calls complete. Adds stacked, the room spiraled, and they wiped.
   - On attempt two, they assigned "interrupt captain" and the fight became straightforward.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found the cache after wiping and treated it as a recovery tool. It softened the frustration and felt fair.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Report in -> rail pass -> teaser. The paladin insisted the safehouse is the actual progression reward.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- cleric: stabilized the second attempt and kept the party from panic-chasing adds.
- paladin: declared a clear "interrupt assignment" plan after the wipe; became the captain.
- warlock: took interrupt duty on attempt two and executed consistently.
- rogue: fixed the pylon 2 pinch by scouting the choke and calling regroup points.
- monk: solved hazard movement in pylon 3 and baited adds away from the backline.
- fighter: none
- wizard: none
- ranger: none
- bard: none
- druid: none
- barbarian: none
- sorcerer: none

## Friction / Missing Content

- Parties need one explicit hint that interrupts are required for safety, not just "nice to have".
- Wave feedback is crucial for resource planning; without it, parties burn cooldowns at random.
- The courtyard should reinforce that route order matters (route-length hints and visible pylon progress help).

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add one explicit first-call hint line (once) that failing to interrupt increases add pressure sharply.
- TODO: Add consistent wave boundary feedback to all pylon rooms.
- TODO: Add a small "regroup here" affordance in pylon 2's approach (terrain or messaging).
