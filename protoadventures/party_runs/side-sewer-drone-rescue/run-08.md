# Party Run: side-sewer-drone-rescue / run-08

## Party

- size: 3
- levels: 4/4/4
- classes: barbarian, bard, druid
- tags: brute-carry, calm-loop, hazard-literate, steady

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the rescue because barbarian wanted to "just carry the drone out" and bard wanted to prove calm mechanics mattered.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Cleared the optional wing first, then started the escort only when the lane was safe.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Panic spikes happened whenever the drone took incidental damage. Bard kept a steady calm loop while druid called hazard pockets to avoid.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Flooded pocket: barbarian carried the drone through after draining one valve, while druid and bard cleared/controlled the lane so the carry didn't become a death march.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Found the keycard door and used it on the way back. It felt like the correct "small party" lane and should be earnable on the same run.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Delivered the drone in good condition. The run felt teachable: clear -> calm -> carry -> reset.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: carry option made the flooded segment solvable without a full puzzle, but required protection.
- bard: calm loop prevented panic fleeing and kept the escort moving.
- druid: hazard literacy; kept the carry route out of sludge pockets and prevented attrition spirals.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Calm interaction needs clear cooldown/duration so parties can plan around it.
- Carry route needs explicit hazard rules; otherwise players don't know if it's safe or suicide.
- Keycard shortcut should be earned during the escort, not only found on repeat runs.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Define calm interaction (duration, cooldown, panic threshold) with clear UI.
- TODO: Define carry mechanics and hazard interactions in a tooltip or quest hint.
- TODO: Add a reliable keycard acquisition step in the optional wing (side chest, console bargain).
