# Party Run: side-sewer-drone-rescue / run-03

## Party

- size: 2
- levels: 5/5
- classes: barbarian, warlock
- tags: brute, bargain, messy, wipe-once

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the rescue because the warlock wanted to test "shortcut keycard bargains."
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Brute-forced through rooms without scouting. Drone got hit and panicked immediately.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - They tried to carry the drone through a flooded section without draining it. Bad idea: slowed, poisoned, nearly wiped.
   - Warlock bargained for a keycard to skip the flooded segment after the wipe.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Ambush room with a trap: barbarian triggered it; drone almost died.
   - They learned to clear rooms before moving the escort.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - The keycard door shortcut felt like the "right" way to do it for small parties, but it must be discoverable.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Delivered the drone with heavy damage taken. Still succeeded, but earned only base vendor unlock.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- barbarian: carried the drone through a bad situation and brute-forced the last choke.
- warlock: bargain for a shortcut keycard changed the route and made success possible.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Small parties need a clear "best practice" path: scout/clear, or pay cost for keycard shortcut.
- Drone panic is too punishing if it's triggered by unavoidable splash damage; needs thresholds.
- Traps should be readable; escort wipes from invisible traps feel cheap.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit small-party guidance: clear/scout lane vs keycard shortcut lane.
- TODO: Tune drone panic thresholds and add clear UI feedback (panic meter).
- TODO: Improve trap readability in escort-critical rooms.
