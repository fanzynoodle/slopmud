# Party Run: side-sewer-drone-rescue / run-07

## Party

- size: 4
- levels: 5/5/5/5
- classes: wizard, sorcerer, ranger, warlock
- tags: all-ranged, splash-risk, fast, drone-safe-lane

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the drone rescue to test whether ranged/AOE parties can keep an escort alive.
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Agreed on one rule: "drone stays behind the line." They parked it in safe pockets and only moved it after rooms were controlled.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Splash risk was real: one mis-aimed effect clipped the drone and spiked panic. They had to shift to targeted hits and use control rather than big blasts.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Ambush loop room: wizard boxed lanes, ranger picked weak targets, sorcerer saved burst for when the drone was safely out of line.
   - Used a keycard door shortcut to bypass the worst flooded pocket once they earned/paid for it.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Shortcut door was great, but the run needed a clearer "keycard available here" signpost.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Delivered the drone quickly with low damage after adapting away from indiscriminate AOE. Success felt earned.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- wizard: lane control so the escort could sit safely while the room was solved.
- ranger: precise targeting; avoided splash that would panic the drone.
- sorcerer: burst discipline; only used big effects when the drone was safely positioned.
- warlock: opted into a keycard bargain/choice to bypass a flooded hazard segment.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Friendly splash rules around the escort must be explicit; parties need to know what can hurt the drone.
- Safe pocket language must be consistent so "park the drone here" is a real tactic.
- Keycard shortcut needs a predictable acquisition method, not a random find.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add explicit escort-friendly-fire rules and UI warnings when the drone is in blast radius.
- TODO: Add consistent safe pocket markers and make the drone prefer them.
- TODO: Add a clear keycard acquisition choice (pay, side objective, or bargain) with visible cost.
