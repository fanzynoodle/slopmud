# Party Run: side-sewer-drone-rescue / run-02

## Party

- size: 5
- levels: 5/5/5/4/4
- classes: paladin, bard, wizard, ranger, monk
- tags: no-one-left, escort, fast, calm-the-drone

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Paladin insisted: "We bring it back. No excuses."
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Monk sprint-scouted and cleared a valve under time pressure while the rest escorted.
   - Ranger chose routes that avoided the worst sludge loops.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Drone panic was the main threat. Bard calmed it repeatedly and kept it moving.
   - Wizard locked down ambush rooms so the escort didn't get stuck fighting in hazards.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Flooded section: drone couldn't cross without being carried or the water being drained.
   - They drained it by flipping two valves in sequence; time pressure made it tense.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - They bargained with a shady maintenance console for a one-use keycard that opened a shortcut door.
6. resolution / rewards
   - Delivered drone quickly; got a better utility vendor unlock (discount) due to speed and low damage taken.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- paladin: "leave no one behind" beat; held escort line.
- bard: calmed the drone and prevented panic behavior from ruining the run.
- wizard: locked down ambush rooms; made escort viable under pressure.
- ranger: route selection and safe lane calls.
- monk: ran ahead and cleared a valve under time pressure.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Valve sequence puzzles need clear feedback when one valve is wrong.
- Shortcuts via keycard should be explicit opt-ins (risk/cost), not random.
- Drone calm interaction should have a cooldown/clarity so parties can plan.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add clear valve puzzle UI feedback (state, correct/incorrect).
- TODO: Implement keycard shortcut as explicit choice with readable cost.
- TODO: Define drone calm mechanics (duration, cooldown, panic threshold).
