# Party Run: side-sewer-drone-rescue / run-05

## Party

- size: 1
- levels: 5
- classes: cleric
- tags: solo, keycard-shortcut, escort, slow-careful

## What They Did (Timeline)

1. hook / acceptance
   - Took the job as a solo utility test: can one player escort the drone without it feeling like babysitting?
2. travel / navigation decisions
   - Cleared every room before starting the escort. The solo cleric refused to move the drone until the lane looked safe.
3. key fights / obstacles
   - Drone panic was manageable only because the cleric kept it topped up and avoided splash pulls.
   - Traps were the scary part: one hidden hit on the drone would have ended the run.
4. setpiece / spike
   - Flooded section: used a keycard shortcut to bypass it. Without the shortcut, solo would have been slow enough to be boring.
5. secret / shortcut (or why they missed it)
   - Keycard lane was the secret, but it needs to be discoverable (clear opt-in cost) instead of "only if you already know."
6. resolution / rewards
   - Delivered the drone intact enough for a speed/low-damage bonus. Solo success felt good when the lane was clear and predictable.

## Spotlight Moments (By Class)

- cleric: managed drone health and panic without needing a second player babysitting.
- cleric: solved the escort by clearing first, then moving (good pacing lesson).
- cleric: used the keycard shortcut to keep solo routing from becoming a long slog.

## Friction / Missing Content

- Solo needs explicit lane design: clear/scout route + keycard option, otherwise it's too slow.
- Traps must be readable when an escort is present; invisible trap hits on the drone feel unacceptable.
- Keycard acquisition needs a clear source (NPC bargain, side objective) so players can plan.

## Extracted TODOs

- TODO: Add an explicit solo/small-party lane recommendation in the quest UI.
- TODO: Improve trap telegraphs in escort-critical rooms (floor markings, audio, preview).
- TODO: Add a clear keycard acquisition step and present it as an opt-in choice.
