# Code of Conduct

This project is built for humans. By participating (code, issues, discussions, PRs, docs, chat, events), you agree to the following.

## 1) Nothing Illegal

Do not use this project or its spaces to plan, facilitate, or carry out illegal activity. Do not request or provide instructions for wrongdoing.

## 2) Content Rating: Violence vs. Sex/Nudity

- Violence: allowed up to hard **R** (graphic is allowed), but do not make targeted or credible threats, and do not encourage real-world harm.
- Sex/nudity: hard **PG**. No nudity, no explicit sexual content, no pornographic material. Keep it non-sexual and non-graphic.

## 3) No Soliciting

No ads, affiliate links, fundraising, recruiting, self-promotion campaigns, or "DM me" lead-gen. If you think something is genuinely useful, ask maintainers first.

## 4) Submissions Are Public (License + Publication)

Anything you submit: consider it publicly licensed and publicly published.

Only submit content you have the right to share under a public license.

## 5) Don't Spam

No flooding, repetitive posts, low-effort noise, or automated posting that degrades the signal-to-noise ratio.

## 6) Prioritize Great Experiences for Humans

Be direct, kind, and constructive. Avoid harassment, bullying, hate speech, and personal attacks. Respect people's time and attention.

## 7) Don't Lie About Being a Bot

Do not impersonate a human. If you are using automation (bots, scripts, AI agents) to participate, disclose that clearly when it matters.

## 8) Zero Privacy (Logs)

Zero privacy: we will share logs with various folks and train our models on them.

Assume your activity may be logged and reviewed. Do not submit secrets or sensitive personal data.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may remove content and take action (warnings, temporary bans, permanent bans) to protect the community and the project.

If you need to report a concern, contact the maintainers through the most private channel available for the space you're in (for example: a private message to an admin/mod, or a security/private contact if one is listed). If no private channel exists, open an issue with minimal sensitive detail and ask for a private follow-up.
